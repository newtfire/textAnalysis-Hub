        <title>OLD MOODIE</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The evening before my departure for Blithedale, I was returning to my</line>
        <line>bachelor apartments, after attending the wonderful exhibition of the</line>
        <line>Veiled Lady, when an elderly man of rather shabby appearance met me in</line>
        <line>an obscure part of the street.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Mr. Coverdale," said he softly, "can I speak with you a moment?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As I have casually alluded to the Veiled Lady, it may not be amiss to</line>
        <line>mention, for the benefit of such of my readers as are unacquainted with</line>
        <line>her now forgotten celebrity, that she was a phenomenon in the mesmeric</line>
        <line>line; one of the earliest that had indicated the birth of a new</line>
        <line>science, or the revival of an old humbug. Since those times her</line>
        <line>sisterhood have grown too numerous to attract much individual notice;</line>
        <line>nor, in fact, has any one of them come before the public under such</line>
        <line>skilfully contrived circumstances of stage effect as those which at</line>
        <line>once mystified and illuminated the remarkable performances of the lady</line>
        <line>in question. Nowadays, in the management of his "subject,"</line>
        <line>"clairvoyant," or "medium," the exhibitor affects the simplicity and</line>
        <line>openness of scientific experiment; and even if he profess to tread a</line>
        <line>step or two across the boundaries of the spiritual world, yet carries</line>
        <line>with him the laws of our actual life and extends them over his</line>
        <line>preternatural conquests. Twelve or fifteen years ago, on the contrary,</line>
        <line>all the arts of mysterious arrangement, of picturesque disposition, and</line>
        <line>artistically contrasted light and shade, were made available, in order</line>
        <line>to set the apparent miracle in the strongest attitude of opposition to</line>
        <line>ordinary facts. In the case of the Veiled Lady, moreover, the interest</line>
        <line>of the spectator was further wrought up by the enigma of her identity,</line>
        <line>and an absurd rumor (probably set afloat by the exhibitor, and at one</line>
        <line>time very prevalent) that a beautiful young lady, of family and</line>
        <line>fortune, was enshrouded within the misty drapery of the veil. It was</line>
        <line>white, with somewhat of a subdued silver sheen, like the sunny side of</line>
        <line>a cloud; and, falling over the wearer from head to foot, was supposed</line>
        <line>to insulate her from the material world, from time and space, and to</line>
        <line>endow her with many of the privileges of a disembodied spirit.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Her pretensions, however, whether miraculous or otherwise, have little</line>
        <line>to do with the present narrative--except, indeed, that I had</line>
        <line>propounded, for the Veiled Lady's prophetic solution, a query as to the</line>
        <line>success of our Blithedale enterprise. The response, by the bye, was of</line>
        <line>the true Sibylline stamp,--nonsensical in its first aspect, yet on</line>
        <line>closer study unfolding a variety of interpretations, one of which has</line>
        <line>certainly accorded with the event. I was turning over this riddle in</line>
        <line>my mind, and trying to catch its slippery purport by the tail, when the</line>
        <line>old man above mentioned interrupted me.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Mr. Coverdale!--Mr. Coverdale!" said he, repeating my name twice, in</line>
        <line>order to make up for the hesitating and ineffectual way in which he</line>
        <line>uttered it. "I ask your pardon, sir, but I hear you are going to</line>
        <line>Blithedale tomorrow."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I knew the pale, elderly face, with the red-tipt nose, and the patch</line>
        <line>over one eye; and likewise saw something characteristic in the old</line>
        <line>fellow's way of standing under the arch of a gate, only revealing</line>
        <line>enough of himself to make me recognize him as an acquaintance. He was</line>
        <line>a very shy personage, this Mr. Moodie; and the trait was the more</line>
        <line>singular, as his mode of getting his bread necessarily brought him into</line>
        <line>the stir and hubbub of the world more than the generality of men.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Yes, Mr. Moodie," I answered, wondering what interest he could take in</line>
        <line>the fact, "it is my intention to go to Blithedale to-morrow. Can I be</line>
        <line>of any service to you before my departure?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"If you pleased, Mr. Coverdale," said he, "you might do me a very great</line>
        <line>favor."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"A very great one?" repeated I, in a tone that must have expressed but</line>
        <line>little alacrity of beneficence, although I was ready to do the old man</line>
        <line>any amount of kindness involving no special trouble to myself. "A very</line>
        <line>great favor, do you say? My time is brief, Mr. Moodie, and I have a</line>
        <line>good many preparations to make. But be good enough to tell me what you</line>
        <line>wish."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, sir," replied Old Moodie, "I don't quite like to do that; and, on</line>
        <line>further thoughts, Mr. Coverdale, perhaps I had better apply to some</line>
        <line>older gentleman, or to some lady, if you would have the kindness to</line>
        <line>make me known to one, who may happen to be going to Blithedale. You are</line>
        <line>a young man, sir!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Does that fact lessen my availability for your purpose?" asked I.</line>
        <line>"However, if an older man will suit you better, there is Mr.</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, who has three or four years the advantage of me in age,</line>
        <line>and is a much more solid character, and a philanthropist to boot. I am</line>
        <line>only a poet, and, so the critics tell me, no great affair at that! But</line>
        <line>what can this business be, Mr. Moodie? It begins to interest me;</line>
        <line>especially since your hint that a lady's influence might be found</line>
        <line>desirable. Come, I am really anxious to be of service to you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But the old fellow, in his civil and demure manner, was both freakish</line>
        <line>and obstinate; and he had now taken some notion or other into his head</line>
        <line>that made him hesitate in his former design.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I wonder, sir," said he, "whether you know a lady whom they call</line>
        <line>Zenobia?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Not personally," I answered, "although I expect that pleasure</line>
        <line>to-morrow, as she has got the start of the rest of us, and is already a</line>
        <line>resident at Blithedale. But have you a literary turn, Mr. Moodie? or</line>
        <line>have you taken up the advocacy of women's rights? or what else can have</line>
        <line>interested you in this lady? Zenobia, by the bye, as I suppose you</line>
        <line>know, is merely her public name; a sort of mask in which she comes</line>
        <line>before the world, retaining all the privileges of privacy,--a</line>
        <line>contrivance, in short, like the white drapery of the Veiled Lady, only</line>
        <line>a little more transparent. But it is late. Will you tell me what I</line>
        <line>can do for you?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Please to excuse me to-night, Mr. Coverdale," said Moodie. "You are</line>
        <line>very kind; but I am afraid I have troubled you, when, after all, there</line>
        <line>may be no need. Perhaps, with your good leave, I will come to your</line>
        <line>lodgings to-morrow morning, before you set out for Blithedale. I wish</line>
        <line>you a good-night, sir, and beg pardon for stopping you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And so he slipt away; and, as he did not show himself the next morning,</line>
        <line>it was only through subsequent events that I ever arrived at a</line>
        <line>plausible conjecture as to what his business could have been. Arriving</line>
        <line>at my room, I threw a lump of cannel coal upon the grate, lighted a</line>
        <line>cigar, and spent an hour in musings of every hue, from the brightest to</line>
        <line>the most sombre; being, in truth, not so very confident as at some</line>
        <line>former periods that this final step, which would mix me up irrevocably</line>
        <line>with the Blithedale affair, was the wisest that could possibly be</line>
        <line>taken. It was nothing short of midnight when I went to bed, after</line>
        <line>drinking a glass of particularly fine sherry on which I used to pride</line>
        <line>myself in those days. It was the very last bottle; and I finished it,</line>
        <line>with a friend, the next forenoon, before setting out for Blithedale.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>BLITHEDALE</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There can hardly remain for me (who am really getting to be a frosty</line>
        <line>bachelor, with another white hair, every week or so, in my mustache),</line>
        <line>there can hardly flicker up again so cheery a blaze upon the hearth, as</line>
        <line>that which I remember, the next day, at Blithedale. It was a wood</line>
        <line>fire, in the parlor of an old farmhouse, on an April afternoon, but</line>
        <line>with the fitful gusts of a wintry snowstorm roaring in the chimney.</line>
        <line>Vividly does that fireside re-create itself, as I rake away the ashes</line>
        <line>from the embers in my memory, and blow them up with a sigh, for lack of</line>
        <line>more inspiring breath. Vividly for an instant, but anon, with the</line>
        <line>dimmest gleam, and with just as little fervency for my heart as for my</line>
        <line>finger-ends! The staunch oaken logs were long ago burnt out. Their</line>
        <line>genial glow must be represented, if at all, by the merest phosphoric</line>
        <line>glimmer, like that which exudes, rather than shines, from damp</line>
        <line>fragments of decayed trees, deluding the benighted wanderer through a</line>
        <line>forest. Around such chill mockery of a fire some few of us might sit</line>
        <line>on the withered leaves, spreading out each a palm towards the imaginary</line>
        <line>warmth, and talk over our exploded scheme for beginning the life of</line>
        <line>Paradise anew.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Paradise, indeed! Nobody else in the world, I am bold to</line>
        <line>affirm--nobody, at least, in our bleak little world of New</line>
        <line>England,--had dreamed of Paradise that day except as the pole suggests</line>
        <line>the tropic. Nor, with such materials as were at hand, could the most</line>
        <line>skilful architect have constructed any better imitation of Eve's bower</line>
        <line>than might be seen in the snow hut of an Esquimaux. But we made a</line>
        <line>summer of it, in spite of the wild drifts.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It was an April day, as already hinted, and well towards the middle of</line>
        <line>the month. When morning dawned upon me, in town, its temperature was</line>
        <line>mild enough to be pronounced even balmy, by a lodger, like myself, in</line>
        <line>one of the midmost houses of a brick block,--each house partaking of</line>
        <line>the warmth of all the rest, besides the sultriness of its individual</line>
        <line>furnace--heat. But towards noon there had come snow, driven along the</line>
        <line>street by a northeasterly blast, and whitening the roofs and sidewalks</line>
        <line>with a business-like perseverance that would have done credit to our</line>
        <line>severest January tempest. It set about its task apparently as much in</line>
        <line>earnest as if it had been guaranteed from a thaw for months to come.</line>
        <line>The greater, surely, was my heroism, when, puffing out a final whiff of</line>
        <line>cigar-smoke, I quitted my cosey pair of bachelor-rooms,--with a good</line>
        <line>fire burning in the grate, and a closet right at hand, where there was</line>
        <line>still a bottle or two in the champagne basket and a residuum of claret</line>
        <line>in a box,--quitted, I say, these comfortable quarters, and plunged into</line>
        <line>the heart of the pitiless snowstorm, in quest of a better life.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The better life! Possibly, it would hardly look so now; it is enough</line>
        <line>if it looked so then. The greatest obstacle to being heroic is the</line>
        <line>doubt whether one may not be going to prove one's self a fool; the</line>
        <line>truest heroism is to resist the doubt; and the profoundest wisdom to</line>
        <line>know when it ought to be resisted, and when to be obeyed.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Yet, after all, let us acknowledge it wiser, if not more sagacious, to</line>
        <line>follow out one's daydream to its natural consummation, although, if the</line>
        <line>vision have been worth the having, it is certain never to be</line>
        <line>consummated otherwise than by a failure. And what of that? Its</line>
        <line>airiest fragments, impalpable as they may be, will possess a value that</line>
        <line>lurks not in the most ponderous realities of any practicable scheme.</line>
        <line>They are not the rubbish of the mind. Whatever else I may repent of,</line>
        <line>therefore, let it be reckoned neither among my sins nor follies that I</line>
        <line>once had faith and force enough to form generous hopes of the world's</line>
        <line>destiny--yes!--and to do what in me lay for their accomplishment; even</line>
        <line>to the extent of quitting a warm fireside, flinging away a freshly</line>
        <line>lighted cigar, and travelling far beyond the strike of city clocks,</line>
        <line>through a drifting snowstorm.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There were four of us who rode together through the storm; and</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, who had agreed to be of the number, was accidentally</line>
        <line>delayed, and set forth at a later hour alone. As we threaded the</line>
        <line>streets, I remember how the buildings on either side seemed to press</line>
        <line>too closely upon us, insomuch that our mighty hearts found barely room</line>
        <line>enough to throb between them. The snowfall, too, looked inexpressibly</line>
        <line>dreary (I had almost called it dingy), coming down through an</line>
        <line>atmosphere of city smoke, and alighting on the sidewalk only to be</line>
        <line>moulded into the impress of somebody's patched boot or overshoe. Thus</line>
        <line>the track of an old conventionalism was visible on what was freshest</line>
        <line>from the sky. But when we left the pavements, and our muffled</line>
        <line>hoof-tramps beat upon a desolate extent of country road, and were</line>
        <line>effaced by the unfettered blast as soon as stamped, then there was</line>
        <line>better air to breathe. Air that had not been breathed once and again!</line>
        <line>air that had not been spoken into words of falsehood, formality, and</line>
        <line>error, like all the air of the dusky city!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"How pleasant it is!" remarked I, while the snowflakes flew into my</line>
        <line>mouth the moment it was opened. "How very mild and balmy is this</line>
        <line>country air!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, Coverdale, don't laugh at what little enthusiasm you have left!"</line>
        <line>said one of my companions. "I maintain that this nitrous atmosphere is</line>
        <line>really exhilarating; and, at any rate, we can never call ourselves</line>
        <line>regenerated men till a February northeaster shall be as grateful to us</line>
        <line>as the softest breeze of June!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>So we all of us took courage, riding fleetly and merrily along, by</line>
        <line>stone fences that were half buried in the wave-like drifts; and through</line>
        <line>patches of woodland, where the tree-trunks opposed a snow-incrusted</line>
        <line>side towards the northeast; and within ken of deserted villas, with no</line>
        <line>footprints in their avenues; and passed scattered dwellings, whence</line>
        <line>puffed the smoke of country fires, strongly impregnated with the</line>
        <line>pungent aroma of burning peat. Sometimes, encountering a traveller, we</line>
        <line>shouted a friendly greeting; and he, unmuffling his ears to the bluster</line>
        <line>and the snow-spray, and listening eagerly, appeared to think our</line>
        <line>courtesy worth less than the trouble which it cost him. The churl! He</line>
        <line>understood the shrill whistle of the blast, but had no intelligence for</line>
        <line>our blithe tones of brotherhood. This lack of faith in our cordial</line>
        <line>sympathy, on the traveller's part, was one among the innumerable tokens</line>
        <line>how difficult a task we had in hand for the reformation of the world.</line>
        <line>We rode on, however, with still unflagging spirits, and made such good</line>
        <line>companionship with the tempest that, at our journey's end, we professed</line>
        <line>ourselves almost loath to bid the rude blusterer good-by. But, to own</line>
        <line>the truth, I was little better than an icicle, and began to be</line>
        <line>suspicious that I had caught a fearful cold.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And now we were seated by the brisk fireside of the old farmhouse, the</line>
        <line>same fire that glimmers so faintly among my reminiscences at the</line>
        <line>beginning of this chapter. There we sat, with the snow melting out of</line>
        <line>our hair and beards, and our faces all ablaze, what with the past</line>
        <line>inclemency and present warmth. It was, indeed, a right good fire that</line>
        <line>we found awaiting us, built up of great, rough logs, and knotty limbs,</line>
        <line>and splintered fragments of an oak-tree, such as farmers are wont to</line>
        <line>keep for their own hearths, since these crooked and unmanageable boughs</line>
        <line>could never be measured into merchantable cords for the market. A</line>
        <line>family of the old Pilgrims might have swung their kettle over precisely</line>
        <line>such a fire as this, only, no doubt, a bigger one; and, contrasting it</line>
        <line>with my coal-grate, I felt so much the more that we had transported</line>
        <line>ourselves a world-wide distance from the system of society that</line>
        <line>shackled us at breakfast-time.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Good, comfortable Mrs. Foster (the wife of stout Silas Foster, who was</line>
        <line>to manage the farm at a fair stipend, and be our tutor in the art of</line>
        <line>husbandry) bade us a hearty welcome. At her back--a back of generous</line>
        <line>breadth--appeared two young women, smiling most hospitably, but looking</line>
        <line>rather awkward withal, as not well knowing what was to be their</line>
        <line>position in our new arrangement of the world. We shook hands</line>
        <line>affectionately all round, and congratulated ourselves that the blessed</line>
        <line>state of brotherhood and sisterhood, at which we aimed, might fairly be</line>
        <line>dated from this moment. Our greetings were hardly concluded when the</line>
        <line>door opened, and Zenobia--whom I had never before seen, important as</line>
        <line>was her place in our enterprise--Zenobia entered the parlor.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>This (as the reader, if at all acquainted with our literary biography,</line>
        <line>need scarcely be told) was not her real name. She had assumed it, in</line>
        <line>the first instance, as her magazine signature; and, as it accorded well</line>
        <line>with something imperial which her friends attributed to this lady's</line>
        <line>figure and deportment, they half-laughingly adopted it in their</line>
        <line>familiar intercourse with her. She took the appellation in good part,</line>
        <line>and even encouraged its constant use; which, in fact, was thus far</line>
        <line>appropriate, that our Zenobia, however humble looked her new</line>
        <line>philosophy, had as much native pride as any queen would have known what</line>
        <line>to do with.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>A KNOT OF DREAMERS</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia bade us welcome, in a fine, frank, mellow voice, and gave each</line>
        <line>of us her hand, which was very soft and warm. She had something</line>
        <line>appropriate, I recollect, to say to every individual; and what she said</line>
        <line>to myself was this:--"I have long wished to know you, Mr. Coverdale,</line>
        <line>and to thank you for your beautiful poetry, some of which I have</line>
        <line>learned by heart; or rather it has stolen into my memory, without my</line>
        <line>exercising any choice or volition about the matter. Of course--permit</line>
        <line>me to say you do not think of relinquishing an occupation in which you</line>
        <line>have done yourself so much credit. I would almost rather give you up</line>
        <line>as an associate, than that the world should lose one of its true poets!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, no; there will not be the slightest danger of that, especially</line>
        <line>after this inestimable praise from Zenobia," said I, smiling, and</line>
        <line>blushing, no doubt, with excess of pleasure. "I hope, on the contrary,</line>
        <line>now to produce something that shall really deserve to be called</line>
        <line>poetry,--true, strong, natural, and sweet, as is the life which we are</line>
        <line>going to lead,--something that shall have the notes of wild birds</line>
        <line>twittering through it, or a strain like the wind anthems in the woods,</line>
        <line>as the case may be."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Is it irksome to you to hear your own verses sung?" asked Zenobia,</line>
        <line>with a gracious smile. "If so, I am very sorry, for you will certainly</line>
        <line>hear me singing them sometimes, in the summer evenings."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Of all things," answered I, "that is what will delight me most."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>While this passed, and while she spoke to my companions, I was taking</line>
        <line>note of Zenobia's aspect; and it impressed itself on me so distinctly,</line>
        <line>that I can now summon her up, like a ghost, a little wanner than the</line>
        <line>life but otherwise identical with it. She was dressed as simply as</line>
        <line>possible, in an American print (I think the dry-goods people call it</line>
        <line>so), but with a silken kerchief, between which and her gown there was</line>
        <line>one glimpse of a white shoulder. It struck me as a great piece of good</line>
        <line>fortune that there should be just that glimpse. Her hair, which was</line>
        <line>dark, glossy, and of singular abundance, was put up rather soberly and</line>
        <line>primly--without curls, or other ornament, except a single flower. It</line>
        <line>was an exotic of rare beauty, and as fresh as if the hothouse gardener</line>
        <line>had just clipt it from the stem. That flower has struck deep root into</line>
        <line>my memory. I can both see it and smell it, at this moment. So</line>
        <line>brilliant, so rare, so costly as it must have been, and yet enduring</line>
        <line>only for a day, it was more indicative of the pride and pomp which had</line>
        <line>a luxuriant growth in Zenobia's character than if a great diamond had</line>
        <line>sparkled among her hair.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Her hand, though very soft, was larger than most women would like to</line>
        <line>have, or than they could afford to have, though not a whit too large in</line>
        <line>proportion with the spacious plan of Zenobia's entire development. It</line>
        <line>did one good to see a fine intellect (as hers really was, although its</line>
        <line>natural tendency lay in another direction than towards literature) so</line>
        <line>fitly cased. She was, indeed, an admirable figure of a woman, just on</line>
        <line>the hither verge of her richest maturity, with a combination of</line>
        <line>features which it is safe to call remarkably beautiful, even if some</line>
        <line>fastidious persons might pronounce them a little deficient in softness</line>
        <line>and delicacy. But we find enough of those attributes everywhere.</line>
        <line>Preferable--by way of variety, at least--was Zenobia's bloom, health,</line>
        <line>and vigor, which she possessed in such overflow that a man might well</line>
        <line>have fallen in love with her for their sake only. In her quiet moods,</line>
        <line>she seemed rather indolent; but when really in earnest, particularly if</line>
        <line>there were a spice of bitter feeling, she grew all alive to her</line>
        <line>finger-tips.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I am the first comer," Zenobia went on to say, while her smile beamed</line>
        <line>warmth upon us all; "so I take the part of hostess for to-day, and</line>
        <line>welcome you as if to my own fireside. You shall be my guests, too, at</line>
        <line>supper. Tomorrow, if you please, we will be brethren and sisters, and</line>
        <line>begin our new life from daybreak."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Have we our various parts assigned?" asked some one.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Oh, we of the softer sex," responded Zenobia, with her mellow, almost</line>
        <line>broad laugh,--most delectable to hear, but not in the least like an</line>
        <line>ordinary woman's laugh,--"we women (there are four of us here already)</line>
        <line>will take the domestic and indoor part of the business, as a matter of</line>
        <line>course. To bake, to boil, to roast, to fry, to stew,--to wash, and</line>
        <line>iron, and scrub, and sweep,--and, at our idler intervals, to repose</line>
        <line>ourselves on knitting and sewing,--these, I suppose, must be feminine</line>
        <line>occupations, for the present. By and by, perhaps, when our individual</line>
        <line>adaptations begin to develop themselves, it may be that some of us who</line>
        <line>wear the petticoat will go afield, and leave the weaker brethren to</line>
        <line>take our places in the kitchen."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What a pity," I remarked, "that the kitchen, and the housework</line>
        <line>generally, cannot be left out of our system altogether! It is odd</line>
        <line>enough that the kind of labor which falls to the lot of women is just</line>
        <line>that which chiefly distinguishes artificial life--the life of</line>
        <line>degenerated mortals--from the life of Paradise. Eve had no dinner-pot,</line>
        <line>and no clothes to mend, and no washing-day."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I am afraid," said Zenobia, with mirth gleaming out of her eyes, "we</line>
        <line>shall find some difficulty in adopting the paradisiacal system for at</line>
        <line>least a month to come. Look at that snowdrift sweeping past the</line>
        <line>window! Are there any figs ripe, do you think? Have the pineapples</line>
        <line>been gathered to-day? Would you like a bread-fruit, or a cocoanut?</line>
        <line>Shall I run out and pluck you some roses? No, no, Mr. Coverdale; the</line>
        <line>only flower hereabouts is the one in my hair, which I got out of a</line>
        <line>greenhouse this morning. As for the garb of Eden," added she,</line>
        <line>shivering playfully, "I shall not assume it till after May-day!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Assuredly Zenobia could not have intended it,--the fault must have been</line>
        <line>entirely in my imagination. But these last words, together with</line>
        <line>something in her manner, irresistibly brought up a picture of that</line>
        <line>fine, perfectly developed figure, in Eve's earliest garment. Her free,</line>
        <line>careless, generous modes of expression often had this effect of</line>
        <line>creating images which, though pure, are hardly felt to be quite</line>
        <line>decorous when born of a thought that passes between man and woman. I</line>
        <line>imputed it, at that time, to Zenobia's noble courage, conscious of no</line>
        <line>harm, and scorning the petty restraints which take the life and color</line>
        <line>out of other women's conversation. There was another peculiarity about</line>
        <line>her. We seldom meet with women nowadays, and in this country, who</line>
        <line>impress us as being women at all,--their sex fades away and goes for</line>
        <line>nothing, in ordinary intercourse. Not so with Zenobia. One felt an</line>
        <line>influence breathing out of her such as we might suppose to come from</line>
        <line>Eve, when she was just made, and her Creator brought her to Adam,</line>
        <line>saying, "Behold! here is a woman!" Not that I would convey the idea of</line>
        <line>especial gentleness, grace, modesty, and shyness, but of a certain warm</line>
        <line>and rich characteristic, which seems, for the most part, to have been</line>
        <line>refined away out of the feminine system.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And now," continued Zenobia, "I must go and help get supper. Do you</line>
        <line>think you can be content, instead of figs, pineapples, and all the</line>
        <line>other delicacies of Adam's supper-table, with tea and toast, and a</line>
        <line>certain modest supply of ham and tongue, which, with the instinct of a</line>
        <line>housewife, I brought hither in a basket? And there shall be bread and</line>
        <line>milk, too, if the innocence of your taste demands it."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The whole sisterhood now went about their domestic avocations, utterly</line>
        <line>declining our offers to assist, further than by bringing wood for the</line>
        <line>kitchen fire from a huge pile in the back yard. After heaping up more</line>
        <line>than a sufficient quantity, we returned to the sitting-room, drew our</line>
        <line>chairs close to the hearth, and began to talk over our prospects.</line>
        <line>Soon, with a tremendous stamping in the entry, appeared Silas Foster,</line>
        <line>lank, stalwart, uncouth, and grizzly-bearded. He came from foddering</line>
        <line>the cattle in the barn, and from the field, where he had been</line>
        <line>ploughing, until the depth of the snow rendered it impossible to draw a</line>
        <line>furrow. He greeted us in pretty much the same tone as if he were</line>
        <line>speaking to his oxen, took a quid from his iron tobacco-box, pulled off</line>
        <line>his wet cowhide boots, and sat down before the fire in his</line>
        <line>stocking-feet. The steam arose from his soaked garments, so that the</line>
        <line>stout yeoman looked vaporous and spectre-like.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, folks," remarked Silas, "you'll be wishing yourselves back to</line>
        <line>town again, if this weather holds."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And, true enough, there was a look of gloom, as the twilight fell</line>
        <line>silently and sadly out of the sky, its gray or sable flakes</line>
        <line>intermingling themselves with the fast-descending snow. The storm, in</line>
        <line>its evening aspect, was decidedly dreary. It seemed to have arisen for</line>
        <line>our especial behoof,--a symbol of the cold, desolate, distrustful</line>
        <line>phantoms that invariably haunt the mind, on the eve of adventurous</line>
        <line>enterprises, to warn us back within the boundaries of ordinary life.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But our courage did not quail. We would not allow ourselves to be</line>
        <line>depressed by the snowdrift trailing past the window, any more than if</line>
        <line>it had been the sigh of a summer wind among rustling boughs. There</line>
        <line>have been few brighter seasons for us than that. If ever men might</line>
        <line>lawfully dream awake, and give utterance to their wildest visions</line>
        <line>without dread of laughter or scorn on the part of the audience,--yes,</line>
        <line>and speak of earthly happiness, for themselves and mankind, as an</line>
        <line>object to be hopefully striven for, and probably attained, we who made</line>
        <line>that little semicircle round the blazing fire were those very men. We</line>
        <line>had left the rusty iron framework of society behind us; we had broken</line>
        <line>through many hindrances that are powerful enough to keep most people on</line>
        <line>the weary treadmill of the established system, even while they feel its</line>
        <line>irksomeness almost as intolerable as we did. We had stepped down from</line>
        <line>the pulpit; we had flung aside the pen; we had shut up the ledger; we</line>
        <line>had thrown off that sweet, bewitching, enervating indolence, which is</line>
        <line>better, after all, than most of the enjoyments within mortal grasp. It</line>
        <line>was our purpose--a generous one, certainly, and absurd, no doubt, in</line>
        <line>full proportion with its generosity--to give up whatever we had</line>
        <line>heretofore attained, for the sake of showing mankind the example of a</line>
        <line>life governed by other than the false and cruel principles on which</line>
        <line>human society has all along been based.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And, first of all, we had divorced ourselves from pride, and were</line>
        <line>striving to supply its place with familiar love. We meant to lessen</line>
        <line>the laboring man's great burden of toil, by performing our due share of</line>
        <line>it at the cost of our own thews and sinews. We sought our profit by</line>
        <line>mutual aid, instead of wresting it by the strong hand from an enemy, or</line>
        <line>filching it craftily from those less shrewd than ourselves (if, indeed,</line>
        <line>there were any such in New England), or winning it by selfish</line>
        <line>competition with a neighbor; in one or another of which fashions every</line>
        <line>son of woman both perpetrates and suffers his share of the common evil,</line>
        <line>whether he chooses it or no. And, as the basis of our institution, we</line>
        <line>purposed to offer up the earnest toil of our bodies, as a prayer no</line>
        <line>less than an effort for the advancement of our race.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Therefore, if we built splendid castles (phalansteries perhaps they</line>
        <line>might be more fitly called), and pictured beautiful scenes, among the</line>
        <line>fervid coals of the hearth around which we were clustering, and if all</line>
        <line>went to rack with the crumbling embers and have never since arisen out</line>
        <line>of the ashes, let us take to ourselves no shame. In my own behalf, I</line>
        <line>rejoice that I could once think better of the world's improvability</line>
        <line>than it deserved. It is a mistake into which men seldom fall twice in</line>
        <line>a lifetime; or, if so, the rarer and higher is the nature that can thus</line>
        <line>magnanimously persist in error.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Stout Silas Foster mingled little in our conversation; but when he did</line>
        <line>speak, it was very much to some practical purpose. For</line>
        <line>instance:--"Which man among you," quoth he, "is the best judge of</line>
        <line>swine? Some of us must go to the next Brighton fair, and buy half a</line>
        <line>dozen pigs."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Pigs! Good heavens! had we come out from among the swinish multitude</line>
        <line>for this? And again, in reference to some discussion about raising</line>
        <line>early vegetables for the market:--"We shall never make any hand at</line>
        <line>market gardening," said Silas Foster, "unless the women folks will</line>
        <line>undertake to do all the weeding. We haven't team enough for that and</line>
        <line>the regular farm-work, reckoning three of your city folks as worth one</line>
        <line>common field-hand. No, no; I tell you, we should have to get up a</line>
        <line>little too early in the morning, to compete with the market gardeners</line>
        <line>round Boston."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It struck me as rather odd, that one of the first questions raised,</line>
        <line>after our separation from the greedy, struggling, self-seeking world,</line>
        <line>should relate to the possibility of getting the advantage over the</line>
        <line>outside barbarians in their own field of labor. But, to own the truth,</line>
        <line>I very soon became sensible that, as regarded society at large, we</line>
        <line>stood in a position of new hostility, rather than new brotherhood. Nor</line>
        <line>could this fail to be the case, in some degree, until the bigger and</line>
        <line>better half of society should range itself on our side. Constituting so</line>
        <line>pitiful a minority as now, we were inevitably estranged from the rest</line>
        <line>of mankind in pretty fair proportion with the strictness of our mutual</line>
        <line>bond among ourselves.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>This dawning idea, however, was driven back into my inner consciousness</line>
        <line>by the entrance of Zenobia. She came with the welcome intelligence</line>
        <line>that supper was on the table. Looking at herself in the glass, and</line>
        <line>perceiving that her one magnificent flower had grown rather languid</line>
        <line>(probably by being exposed to the fervency of the kitchen fire), she</line>
        <line>flung it on the floor, as unconcernedly as a village girl would throw</line>
        <line>away a faded violet. The action seemed proper to her character,</line>
        <line>although, methought, it would still more have befitted the bounteous</line>
        <line>nature of this beautiful woman to scatter fresh flowers from her hand,</line>
        <line>and to revive faded ones by her touch. Nevertheless, it was a singular</line>
        <line>but irresistible effect; the presence of Zenobia caused our heroic</line>
        <line>enterprise to show like an illusion, a masquerade, a pastoral, a</line>
        <line>counterfeit Arcadia, in which we grown-up men and women were making a</line>
        <line>play-day of the years that were given us to live in. I tried to</line>
        <line>analyze this impression, but not with much success.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It really vexes me," observed Zenobia, as we left the room, "that Mr.</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth should be such a laggard. I should not have thought him</line>
        <line>at all the sort of person to be turned back by a puff of contrary wind,</line>
        <line>or a few snowflakes drifting into his face."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Do you know Hollingsworth personally?" I inquired.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No; only as an auditor--auditress, I mean--of some of his lectures,"</line>
        <line>said she. "What a voice he has! and what a man he is! Yet not so much</line>
        <line>an intellectual man, I should say, as a great heart; at least, he moved</line>
        <line>me more deeply than I think myself capable of being moved, except by</line>
        <line>the stroke of a true, strong heart against my own. It is a sad pity</line>
        <line>that he should have devoted his glorious powers to such a grimy,</line>
        <line>unbeautiful, and positively hopeless object as this reformation of</line>
        <line>criminals, about which he makes himself and his wretchedly small</line>
        <line>audiences so very miserable. To tell you a secret, I never could</line>
        <line>tolerate a philanthropist before. Could you?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"By no means," I answered; "neither can I now."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"They are, indeed, an odiously disagreeable set of mortals," continued</line>
        <line>Zenobia. "I should like Mr. Hollingsworth a great deal better if the</line>
        <line>philanthropy had been left out. At all events, as a mere matter of</line>
        <line>taste, I wish he would let the bad people alone, and try to benefit</line>
        <line>those who are not already past his help. Do you suppose he will be</line>
        <line>content to spend his life, or even a few months of it, among tolerably</line>
        <line>virtuous and comfortable individuals like ourselves?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Upon my word, I doubt it," said "If we wish to keep him with us, we</line>
        <line>must systematically commit at least one crime apiece! Mere peccadillos</line>
        <line> will not satisfy him."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia turned, sidelong, a strange kind of a glance upon me; but,</line>
        <line>before I could make out what it meant, we had entered the kitchen,</line>
        <line>where, in accordance with the rustic simplicity of our new life, the</line>
        <line>supper-table was spread.</line>
    </p>

        <title>THE SUPPER-TABLE</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The pleasant firelight! I must still keep harping on it. The kitchen</line>
        <line>hearth had an old-fashioned breadth, depth, and spaciousness, far</line>
        <line>within which lay what seemed the butt of a good-sized oak-tree, with</line>
        <line>the moisture bubbling merrily out at both ends. It was now half an</line>
        <line>hour beyond dusk. The blaze from an armful of substantial sticks,</line>
        <line>rendered more combustible by brushwood and pine, flickered powerfully</line>
        <line>on the smoke-blackened walls, and so cheered our spirits that we cared</line>
        <line>not what inclemency might rage and roar on the other side of our</line>
        <line>illuminated windows. A yet sultrier warmth was bestowed by a goodly</line>
        <line>quantity of peat, which was crumbling to white ashes among the burning</line>
        <line>brands, and incensed the kitchen with its not ungrateful fragrance.</line>
        <line>The exuberance of this household fire would alone have sufficed to</line>
        <line>bespeak us no true farmers; for the New England yeoman, if he have the</line>
        <line>misfortune to dwell within practicable distance of a wood-market, is as</line>
        <line>niggardly of each stick as if it were a bar of California gold.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But it was fortunate for us, on that wintry eve of our untried life, to</line>
        <line>enjoy the warm and radiant luxury of a somewhat too abundant fire. If</line>
        <line>it served no other purpose, it made the men look so full of youth, warm</line>
        <line>blood, and hope, and the women--such of them, at least, as were anywise</line>
        <line>convertible by its magic--so very beautiful, that I would cheerfully</line>
        <line>have spent my last dollar to prolong the blaze. As for Zenobia, there</line>
        <line>was a glow in her cheeks that made me think of Pandora, fresh from</line>
        <line>Vulcan's workshop, and full of the celestial warmth by dint of which he</line>
        <line>had tempered and moulded her.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Take your places, my dear friends all," cried she; "seat yourselves</line>
        <line>without ceremony, and you shall be made happy with such tea as not many</line>
        <line>of the world's working-people, except yourselves, will find in their</line>
        <line>cups to-night. After this one supper, you may drink buttermilk, if you</line>
        <line>please. To-night we will quaff this nectar, which, I assure you, could</line>
        <line>not be bought with gold."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>We all sat down,--grizzly Silas Foster, his rotund helpmate, and the</line>
        <line>two bouncing handmaidens, included,--and looked at one another in a</line>
        <line>friendly but rather awkward way. It was the first practical trial of</line>
        <line>our theories of equal brotherhood and sisterhood; and we people of</line>
        <line>superior cultivation and refinement (for as such, I presume, we</line>
        <line>unhesitatingly reckoned ourselves) felt as if something were already</line>
        <line>accomplished towards the millennium of love. The truth is, however,</line>
        <line>that the laboring oar was with our unpolished companions; it being far</line>
        <line>easier to condescend than to accept of condescension. Neither did I</line>
        <line>refrain from questioning, in secret, whether some of us--and Zenobia</line>
        <line>among the rest--would so quietly have taken our places among these good</line>
        <line>people, save for the cherished consciousness that it was not by</line>
        <line>necessity but choice. Though we saw fit to drink our tea out of</line>
        <line>earthen cups to-night, and in earthen company, it was at our own option</line>
        <line>to use pictured porcelain and handle silver forks again to-morrow.</line>
        <line>This same salvo, as to the power of regaining our former position,</line>
        <line>contributed much, I fear, to the equanimity with which we subsequently</line>
        <line>bore many of the hardships and humiliations of a life of toil. If ever</line>
        <line>I have deserved (which has not often been the case, and, I think,</line>
        <line>never), but if ever I did deserve to be soundly cuffed by a fellow</line>
        <line>mortal, for secretly putting weight upon some imaginary social</line>
        <line>advantage, it must have been while I was striving to prove myself</line>
        <line>ostentatiously his equal and no more. It was while I sat beside him on</line>
        <line>his cobbler's bench, or clinked my hoe against his own in the</line>
        <line>cornfield, or broke the same crust of bread, my earth-grimed hand to</line>
        <line>his, at our noontide lunch. The poor, proud man should look at both</line>
        <line>sides of sympathy like this.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The silence which followed upon our sitting down to table grew rather</line>
        <line>oppressive; indeed, it was hardly broken by a word, during the first</line>
        <line>round of Zenobia's fragrant tea.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I hope," said I, at last, "that our blazing windows will be visible a</line>
        <line>great way off. There is nothing so pleasant and encouraging to a</line>
        <line>solitary traveller, on a stormy night, as a flood of firelight seen</line>
        <line>amid the gloom. These ruddy window panes cannot fail to cheer the</line>
        <line>hearts of all that look at them. Are they not warm with the</line>
        <line>beacon-fire which we have kindled for humanity?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"The blaze of that brushwood will only last a minute or two longer,"</line>
        <line>observed Silas Foster; but whether he meant to insinuate that our moral</line>
        <line>illumination would have as brief a term, I cannot say.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Meantime," said Zenobia, "it may serve to guide some wayfarer to a</line>
        <line>shelter."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And, just as she said this, there came a knock at the house door.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"There is one of the world's wayfarers," said "Ay, ay, just so!"</line>
        <line>quoth Silas Foster. "Our firelight will draw stragglers, just as a</line>
        <line>candle draws dorbugs on a summer night."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Whether to enjoy a dramatic suspense, or that we were selfishly</line>
        <line>contrasting our own comfort with the chill and dreary situation of the</line>
        <line>unknown person at the threshold, or that some of us city folk felt a</line>
        <line>little startled at the knock which came so unseasonably, through night</line>
        <line>and storm, to the door of the lonely farmhouse,--so it happened that</line>
        <line>nobody, for an instant or two, arose to answer the summons. Pretty</line>
        <line>soon there came another knock. The first had been moderately loud; the</line>
        <line>second was smitten so forcibly that the knuckles of the applicant must</line>
        <line>have left their mark in the door panel.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"He knocks as if he had a right to come in," said Zenobia, laughing.</line>
        <line>"And what are we thinking of?--It must be Mr. Hollingsworth!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hereupon I went to the door, unbolted, and flung it wide open. There,</line>
        <line>sure enough, stood Hollingsworth, his shaggy greatcoat all covered with</line>
        <line>snow, so that he looked quite as much like a polar bear as a modern</line>
        <line>philanthropist.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Sluggish hospitality this!" said he, in those deep tones of his, which</line>
        <line>seemed to come out of a chest as capacious as a barrel. "It would have</line>
        <line>served you right if I had lain down and spent the night on the</line>
        <line>doorstep, just for the sake of putting you to shame. But here is a</line>
        <line>guest who will need a warmer and softer bed."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And, stepping back to the wagon in which he had journeyed hither,</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth received into his arms and deposited on the doorstep a</line>
        <line>figure enveloped in a cloak. It was evidently a woman; or,</line>
        <line>rather,--judging from the ease with which he lifted her, and the little</line>
        <line>space which she seemed to fill in his arms, a slim and unsubstantial</line>
        <line>girl. As she showed some hesitation about entering the door,</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, with his usual directness and lack of ceremony, urged</line>
        <line>her forward not merely within the entry, but into the warm and strongly</line>
        <line>lighted kitchen.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Who is this?" whispered I, remaining behind with him, while he was</line>
        <line>taking off his greatcoat.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Who? Really, I don't know," answered Hollingsworth, looking at me</line>
        <line>with some surprise. "It is a young person who belongs here, however;</line>
        <line>and no doubt she had been expected. Zenobia, or some of the women</line>
        <line>folks, can tell you all about it."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I think not," said I, glancing towards the new-comer and the other</line>
        <line>occupants of the kitchen. "Nobody seems to welcome her. I should</line>
        <line>hardly judge that she was an expected guest."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, well," said Hollingsworth quietly, "We'll make it right."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The stranger, or whatever she were, remained standing precisely on that</line>
        <line>spot of the kitchen floor to which Hollingsworth's kindly hand had</line>
        <line>impelled her. The cloak falling partly off, she was seen to be a very</line>
        <line>young woman dressed in a poor but decent gown, made high in the neck,</line>
        <line>and without any regard to fashion or smartness. Her brown hair fell</line>
        <line>down from beneath a hood, not in curls but with only a slight wave; her</line>
        <line>face was of a wan, almost sickly hue, betokening habitual seclusion</line>
        <line>from the sun and free atmosphere, like a flower-shrub that had done its</line>
        <line>best to blossom in too scanty light. To complete the pitiableness of</line>
        <line>her aspect, she shivered either with cold, or fear, or nervous</line>
        <line>excitement, so that you might have beheld her shadow vibrating on the</line>
        <line>fire-lighted wall. In short, there has seldom been seen so depressed</line>
        <line>and sad a figure as this young girl's; and it was hardly possible to</line>
        <line>help being angry with her, from mere despair of doing anything for her</line>
        <line>comfort. The fantasy occurred to me that she was some desolate kind of</line>
        <line>a creature, doomed to wander about in snowstorms; and that, though the</line>
        <line>ruddiness of our window panes had tempted her into a human dwelling,</line>
        <line>she would not remain long enough to melt the icicles out of her hair.</line>
        <line>Another conjecture likewise came into my mind. Recollecting</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's sphere of philanthropic action, I deemed it possible</line>
        <line>that he might have brought one of his guilty patients, to be wrought</line>
        <line>upon and restored to spiritual health by the pure influences which our</line>
        <line>mode of life would create.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As yet the girl had not stirred. She stood near the door, fixing a</line>
        <line>pair of large, brown, melancholy eyes upon Zenobia--only upon</line>
        <line>Zenobia!--she evidently saw nothing else in the room save that bright,</line>
        <line>fair, rosy, beautiful woman. It was the strangest look I ever</line>
        <line>witnessed; long a mystery to me, and forever a memory. Once she seemed</line>
        <line>about to move forward and greet her,--I know not with what warmth or</line>
        <line>with what words,--but, finally, instead of doing so, she dropped down</line>
        <line>upon her knees, clasped her hands, and gazed piteously into Zenobia's</line>
        <line>face. Meeting no kindly reception, her head fell on her bosom.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I never thoroughly forgave Zenobia for her conduct on this occasion.</line>
        <line>But women are always more cautious in their casual hospitalities than</line>
        <line>men.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What does the girl mean?" cried she in rather a sharp tone. "Is she</line>
        <line>crazy? Has she no tongue?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And here Hollingsworth stepped forward.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No wonder if the poor child's tongue is frozen in her mouth," said he;</line>
        <line>and I think he positively frowned at Zenobia. "The very heart will be</line>
        <line>frozen in her bosom, unless you women can warm it, among you, with the</line>
        <line>warmth that ought to be in your own!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hollingsworth's appearance was very striking at this moment. He was</line>
        <line>then about thirty years old, but looked several years older, with his</line>
        <line>great shaggy head, his heavy brow, his dark complexion, his abundant</line>
        <line>beard, and the rude strength with which his features seemed to have</line>
        <line>been hammered out of iron, rather than chiselled or moulded from any</line>
        <line>finer or softer material. His figure was not tall, but massive and</line>
        <line>brawny, and well befitting his original occupation; which as the reader</line>
        <line>probably knows--was that of a blacksmith. As for external polish, or</line>
        <line>mere courtesy of manner, he never possessed more than a tolerably</line>
        <line>educated bear; although, in his gentler moods, there was a tenderness</line>
        <line>in his voice, eyes, mouth, in his gesture, and in every indescribable</line>
        <line>manifestation, which few men could resist and no woman. But he now</line>
        <line>looked stern and reproachful; and it was with that inauspicious meaning</line>
        <line>in his glance that Hollingsworth first met Zenobia's eyes, and began</line>
        <line>his influence upon her life.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>To my surprise, Zenobia--of whose haughty spirit I had been told so</line>
        <line>many examples--absolutely changed color, and seemed mortified and</line>
        <line>confused.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You do not quite do me justice, Mr. Hollingsworth," said she almost</line>
        <line>humbly. "I am willing to be kind to the poor girl. Is she a protegee</line>
        <line>of yours? What can I do for her?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Have you anything to ask of this lady?" said Hollingsworth kindly to</line>
        <line>the girl. "I remember you mentioned her name before we left town."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Only that she will shelter me," replied the girl tremulously. "Only</line>
        <line>that she will let me be always near her."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, indeed," exclaimed Zenobia, recovering herself and laughing,</line>
        <line>"this is an adventure, and well-worthy to be the first incident in our</line>
        <line>life of love and free-heartedness! But I accept it, for the present,</line>
        <line>without further question, only," added she, "it would be a convenience</line>
        <line>if we knew your name."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Priscilla," said the girl; and it appeared to me that she hesitated</line>
        <line>whether to add anything more, and decided in the negative. "Pray do</line>
        <line>not ask me my other name,--at least not yet,--if you will be so kind to</line>
        <line>a forlorn creature."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Priscilla!--Priscilla! I repeated the name to myself three or four</line>
        <line>times; and in that little space, this quaint and prim cognomen had so</line>
        <line>amalgamated itself with my idea of the girl, that it seemed as if no</line>
        <line>other name could have adhered to her for a moment. Heretofore the poor</line>
        <line>thing had not shed any tears; but now that she found herself received,</line>
        <line>and at least temporarily established, the big drops began to ooze out</line>
        <line>from beneath her eyelids as if she were full of them. Perhaps it showed</line>
        <line>the iron substance of my heart, that I could not help smiling at this</line>
        <line>odd scene of unknown and unaccountable calamity, into which our</line>
        <line>cheerful party had been entrapped without the liberty of choosing</line>
        <line>whether to sympathize or no. Hollingsworth's behavior was certainly a</line>
        <line>great deal more creditable than mine.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Let us not pry further into her secrets," he said to Zenobia and the</line>
        <line>rest of us, apart; and his dark, shaggy face looked really beautiful</line>
        <line>with its expression of thoughtful benevolence. "Let us conclude that</line>
        <line>Providence has sent her to us, as the first-fruits of the world, which</line>
        <line>we have undertaken to make happier than we find it. Let us warm her</line>
        <line>poor, shivering body with this good fire, and her poor, shivering heart</line>
        <line>with our best kindness. Let us feed her, and make her one of us. As</line>
        <line>we do by this friendless girl, so shall we prosper. And, in good time,</line>
        <line>whatever is desirable for us to know will be melted out of her, as</line>
        <line>inevitably as those tears which we see now."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"At least," remarked I, "you may tell us how and where you met with</line>
        <line>her."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"An old man brought her to my lodgings," answered Hollingsworth, "and</line>
        <line>begged me to convey her to Blithedale, where--so I understood him--she</line>
        <line>had friends; and this is positively all I know about the matter."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Grim Silas Foster, all this while, had been busy at the supper-table,</line>
        <line>pouring out his own tea and gulping it down with no more sense of its</line>
        <line>exquisiteness than if it were a decoction of catnip; helping himself to</line>
        <line>pieces of dipt toast on the flat of his knife blade, and dropping half</line>
        <line>of it on the table-cloth; using the same serviceable implement to cut</line>
        <line>slice after slice of ham; perpetrating terrible enormities with the</line>
        <line>butter-plate; and in all other respects behaving less like a civilized</line>
        <line>Christian than the worst kind of an ogre. Being by this time fully</line>
        <line>gorged, he crowned his amiable exploits with a draught from the water</line>
        <line>pitcher, and then favored us with his opinion about the business in</line>
        <line>hand. And, certainly, though they proceeded out of an unwiped mouth,</line>
        <line>his expressions did him honor.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Give the girl a hot cup of tea and a thick slice of this first-rate</line>
        <line>bacon," said Silas, like a sensible man as he was. "That's what she</line>
        <line>wants. Let her stay with us as long as she likes, and help in the</line>
        <line>kitchen, and take the cow-breath at milking time; and, in a week or</line>
        <line>two, she'll begin to look like a creature of this world."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>So we sat down again to supper, and Priscilla along with us.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>UNTIL BEDTIME</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Silas Foster, by the time we concluded our meal, had stript off his</line>
        <line>coat, and planted himself on a low chair by the kitchen fire, with a</line>
        <line>lapstone, a hammer, a piece of sole leather, and some waxed-ends, in</line>
        <line>order to cobble an old pair of cowhide boots; he being, in his own</line>
        <line>phrase, "something of a dab" (whatever degree of skill that may imply)</line>
        <line>at the shoemaking business. We heard the tap of his hammer at</line>
        <line>intervals for the rest of the evening. The remainder of the party</line>
        <line>adjourned to the sitting-room. Good Mrs. Foster took her</line>
        <line>knitting-work, and soon fell fast asleep, still keeping her needles in</line>
        <line>brisk movement, and, to the best of my observation, absolutely footing</line>
        <line>a stocking out of the texture of a dream. And a very substantial</line>
        <line>stocking it seemed to be. One of the two handmaidens hemmed a towel,</line>
        <line>and the other appeared to be making a ruffle, for her Sunday's wear,</line>
        <line>out of a little bit of embroidered muslin which Zenobia had probably</line>
        <line>given her.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It was curious to observe how trustingly, and yet how timidly, our poor</line>
        <line>Priscilla betook herself into the shadow of Zenobia's protection. She</line>
        <line>sat beside her on a stool, looking up every now and then with an</line>
        <line>expression of humble delight at her new friend's beauty. A brilliant</line>
        <line>woman is often an object of the devoted admiration--it might almost be</line>
        <line>termed worship, or idolatry--of some young girl, who perhaps beholds</line>
        <line>the cynosure only at an awful distance, and has as little hope of</line>
        <line>personal intercourse as of climbing among the stars of heaven. We men</line>
        <line>are too gross to comprehend it. Even a woman, of mature age, despises</line>
        <line>or laughs at such a passion. There occurred to me no mode of</line>
        <line>accounting for Priscilla's behavior, except by supposing that she had</line>
        <line>read some of Zenobia's stories (as such literature goes everywhere), or</line>
        <line>her tracts in defence of the sex, and had come hither with the one</line>
        <line>purpose of being her slave. There is nothing parallel to this, I</line>
        <line>believe,--nothing so foolishly disinterested, and hardly anything so</line>
        <line>beautiful,--in the masculine nature, at whatever epoch of life; or, if</line>
        <line>there be, a fine and rare development of character might reasonably be</line>
        <line>looked for from the youth who should prove himself capable of such</line>
        <line>self-forgetful affection.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia happening to change her seat, I took the opportunity, in an</line>
        <line>undertone, to suggest some such notion as the above.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Since you see the young woman in so poetical a light," replied she in</line>
        <line>the same tone, "you had better turn the affair into a ballad. It is a</line>
        <line>grand subject, and worthy of supernatural machinery. The storm, the</line>
        <line>startling knock at the door, the entrance of the sable knight</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth and this shadowy snow-maiden, who, precisely at the</line>
        <line>stroke of midnight, shall melt away at my feet in a pool of ice-cold</line>
        <line>water and give me my death with a pair of wet slippers! And when the</line>
        <line>verses are written, and polished quite to your mind, I will favor you</line>
        <line>with my idea as to what the girl really is."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Pray let me have it now," said I; "it shall be woven into the ballad."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"She is neither more nor less," answered Zenobia, "than a seamstress</line>
        <line>from the city; and she has probably no more transcendental purpose than</line>
        <line>to do my miscellaneous sewing, for I suppose she will hardly expect to</line>
        <line>make my dresses."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"How can you decide upon her so easily?" I inquired.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Oh, we women judge one another by tokens that escape the obtuseness of</line>
        <line>masculine perceptions!" said Zenobia. "There is no proof which you</line>
        <line>would be likely to appreciate, except the needle marks on the tip of</line>
        <line>her forefinger. Then, my supposition perfectly accounts for her</line>
        <line>paleness, her nervousness, and her wretched fragility. Poor thing! She</line>
        <line>has been stifled with the heat of a salamander stove, in a small, close</line>
        <line>room, and has drunk coffee, and fed upon doughnuts, raisins, candy, and</line>
        <line>all such trash, till she is scarcely half alive; and so, as she has</line>
        <line>hardly any physique, a poet like Mr. Miles Coverdale may be allowed to</line>
        <line>think her spiritual."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Look at her now!" whispered I.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Priscilla was gazing towards us with an inexpressible sorrow in her wan</line>
        <line>face and great tears running down her cheeks. It was difficult to</line>
        <line>resist the impression that, cautiously as we had lowered our voices,</line>
        <line>she must have overheard and been wounded by Zenobia's scornful estimate</line>
        <line>of her character and purposes.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What ears the girl must have!" whispered Zenobia, with a look of</line>
        <line>vexation, partly comic and partly real. "I will confess to you that I</line>
        <line>cannot quite make her out. However, I am positively not an ill-natured</line>
        <line>person, unless when very grievously provoked,--and as you, and</line>
        <line>especially Mr. Hollingsworth, take so much interest in this odd</line>
        <line>creature, and as she knocks with a very slight tap against my own heart</line>
        <line>likewise,--why, I mean to let her in. From this moment I will be</line>
        <line>reasonably kind to her. There is no pleasure in tormenting a person of</line>
        <line>one's own sex, even if she do favor one with a little more love than</line>
        <line>one can conveniently dispose of; and that, let me say, Mr. Coverdale,</line>
        <line>is the most troublesome offence you can offer to a woman."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Thank you," said I, smiling; "I don't mean to be guilty of it."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She went towards Priscilla, took her hand, and passed her own rosy</line>
        <line>finger-tips, with a pretty, caressing movement, over the girl's hair.</line>
        <line>The touch had a magical effect. So vivid a look of joy flushed up</line>
        <line>beneath those fingers, that it seemed as if the sad and wan Priscilla</line>
        <line>had been snatched away, and another kind of creature substituted in her</line>
        <line>place. This one caress, bestowed voluntarily by Zenobia, was evidently</line>
        <line>received as a pledge of all that the stranger sought from her, whatever</line>
        <line>the unuttered boon might be. From that instant, too, she melted in</line>
        <line>quietly amongst us, and was no longer a foreign element. Though always</line>
        <line>an object of peculiar interest, a riddle, and a theme of frequent</line>
        <line>discussion, her tenure at Blithedale was thenceforth fixed. We no more</line>
        <line>thought of questioning it, than if Priscilla had been recognized as a</line>
        <line>domestic sprite, who had haunted the rustic fireside of old, before we</line>
        <line>had ever been warmed by its blaze.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She now produced, out of a work-bag that she had with her, some little</line>
        <line>wooden instruments (what they are called I never knew), and proceeded</line>
        <line>to knit, or net, an article which ultimately took the shape of a silk</line>
        <line>purse. As the work went on, I remembered to have seen just such purses</line>
        <line>before; indeed, I was the possessor of one. Their peculiar excellence,</line>
        <line>besides the great delicacy and beauty of the manufacture, lay in the</line>
        <line>almost impossibility that any uninitiated person should discover the</line>
        <line>aperture; although, to a practised touch, they would open as wide as</line>
        <line>charity or prodigality might wish. I wondered if it were not a symbol</line>
        <line>of Priscilla's own mystery.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Notwithstanding the new confidence with which Zenobia had inspired her,</line>
        <line>our guest showed herself disquieted by the storm. When the strong</line>
        <line>puffs of wind spattered the snow against the windows and made the oaken</line>
        <line>frame of the farmhouse creak, she looked at us apprehensively, as if to</line>
        <line>inquire whether these tempestuous outbreaks did not betoken some</line>
        <line>unusual mischief in the shrieking blast. She had been bred up, no</line>
        <line>doubt, in some close nook, some inauspiciously sheltered court of the</line>
        <line>city, where the uttermost rage of a tempest, though it might scatter</line>
        <line>down the slates of the roof into the bricked area, could not shake the</line>
        <line>casement of her little room. The sense of vast, undefined space,</line>
        <line>pressing from the outside against the black panes of our uncurtained</line>
        <line>windows, was fearful to the poor girl, heretofore accustomed to the</line>
        <line>narrowness of human limits, with the lamps of neighboring tenements</line>
        <line>glimmering across the street. The house probably seemed to her adrift</line>
        <line>on the great ocean of the night. A little parallelogram of sky was all</line>
        <line>that she had hitherto known of nature, so that she felt the awfulness</line>
        <line>that really exists in its limitless extent. Once, while the blast was</line>
        <line>bellowing, she caught hold of Zenobia's robe, with precisely the air of</line>
        <line>one who hears her own name spoken at a distance, but is unutterably</line>
        <line>reluctant to obey the call.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>We spent rather an incommunicative evening. Hollingsworth hardly said</line>
        <line>a word, unless when repeatedly and pertinaciously addressed. Then,</line>
        <line>indeed, he would glare upon us from the thick shrubbery of his</line>
        <line>meditations like a tiger out of a jungle, make the briefest reply</line>
        <line>possible, and betake himself back into the solitude of his heart and</line>
        <line>mind. The poor fellow had contracted this ungracious habit from the</line>
        <line>intensity with which he contemplated his own ideas, and the infrequent</line>
        <line>sympathy which they met with from his auditors,--a circumstance that</line>
        <line>seemed only to strengthen the implicit confidence that he awarded to</line>
        <line>them. His heart, I imagine, was never really interested in our</line>
        <line>socialist scheme, but was forever busy with his strange, and, as most</line>
        <line>people thought it, impracticable plan, for the reformation of criminals</line>
        <line>through an appeal to their higher instincts.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Much as I liked Hollingsworth, it cost me many a groan to tolerate him</line>
        <line>on this point. He ought to have commenced his investigation of the</line>
        <line>subject by perpetrating some huge sin in his proper person, and</line>
        <line>examining the condition of his higher instincts afterwards.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The rest of us formed ourselves into a committee for providing our</line>
        <line>infant community with an appropriate name,--a matter of greatly more</line>
        <line>difficulty than the uninitiated reader would suppose. Blithedale was</line>
        <line>neither good nor bad. We should have resumed the old Indian name of</line>
        <line>the premises, had it possessed the oil-and-honey flow which the</line>
        <line>aborigines were so often happy in communicating to their local</line>
        <line>appellations; but it chanced to be a harsh, ill-connected, and</line>
        <line>interminable word, which seemed to fill the mouth with a mixture of</line>
        <line>very stiff clay and very crumbly pebbles. Zenobia suggested "Sunny</line>
        <line>Glimpse," as expressive of a vista into a better system of society.</line>
        <line>This we turned over and over for a while, acknowledging its prettiness,</line>
        <line>but concluded it to be rather too fine and sentimental a name (a fault</line>
        <line>inevitable by literary ladies in such attempts) for sunburnt men to</line>
        <line>work under. I ventured to whisper "Utopia," which, however, was</line>
        <line>unanimously scouted down, and the proposer very harshly maltreated, as</line>
        <line>if he had intended a latent satire. Some were for calling our</line>
        <line>institution "The Oasis," in view of its being the one green spot in the</line>
        <line>moral sand-waste of the world; but others insisted on a proviso for</line>
        <line>reconsidering the matter at a twelvemonths' end, when a final decision</line>
        <line>might be had, whether to name it "The Oasis" or "Sahara." So, at last,</line>
        <line>finding it impracticable to hammer out anything better, we resolved</line>
        <line>that the spot should still be Blithedale, as being of good augury</line>
        <line>enough.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The evening wore on, and the outer solitude looked in upon us through</line>
        <line>the windows, gloomy, wild, and vague, like another state of existence,</line>
        <line>close beside the little sphere of warmth and light in which we were the</line>
        <line>prattlers and bustlers of a moment. By and by the door was opened by</line>
        <line>Silas Foster, with a cotton handkerchief about his head, and a tallow</line>
        <line>candle in his hand.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Take my advice, brother farmers," said he, with a great, broad,</line>
        <line>bottomless yawn, "and get to bed as soon as you can. I shall sound the</line>
        <line>horn at daybreak; and we've got the cattle to fodder, and nine cows to</line>
        <line>milk, and a dozen other things to do, before breakfast."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Thus ended the first evening at Blithedale. I went shivering to my</line>
        <line>fireless chamber, with the miserable consciousness (which had been</line>
        <line>growing upon me for several hours past) that I had caught a tremendous</line>
        <line>cold, and should probably awaken, at the blast of the horn, a fit</line>
        <line>subject for a hospital. The night proved a feverish one. During the</line>
        <line>greater part of it, I was in that vilest of states when a fixed idea</line>
        <line>remains in the mind, like the nail in Sisera's brain, while innumerable</line>
        <line>other ideas go and come, and flutter to and fro, combining constant</line>
        <line>transition with intolerable sameness. Had I made a record of that</line>
        <line>night's half-waking dreams, it is my belief that it would have</line>
        <line>anticipated several of the chief incidents of this narrative, including</line>
        <line>a dim shadow of its catastrophe. Starting up in bed at length, I saw</line>
        <line>that the storm was past, and the moon was shining on the snowy</line>
        <line>landscape, which looked like a lifeless copy of the world in marble.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>From the bank of the distant river, which was shimmering in the</line>
        <line>moonlight, came the black shadow of the only cloud in heaven, driven</line>
        <line>swiftly by the wind, and passing over meadow and hillock, vanishing</line>
        <line>amid tufts of leafless trees, but reappearing on the hither side, until</line>
        <line>it swept across our doorstep.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>How cold an Arcadia was this!</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>COVERDALE'S SICK-CHAMBER</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The horn sounded at daybreak, as Silas Foster had forewarned us, harsh,</line>
        <line>uproarious, inexorably drawn out, and as sleep-dispelling as if this</line>
        <line>hard-hearted old yeoman had got hold of the trump of doom.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>On all sides I could hear the creaking of the bedsteads, as the</line>
        <line>brethren of Blithedale started from slumber, and thrust themselves into</line>
        <line>their habiliments, all awry, no doubt, in their haste to begin the</line>
        <line>reformation of the world. Zenobia put her head into the entry, and</line>
        <line>besought Silas Foster to cease his clamor, and to be kind enough to</line>
        <line>leave an armful of firewood and a pail of water at her chamber door.</line>
        <line>Of the whole household,--unless, indeed, it were Priscilla, for whose</line>
        <line>habits, in this particular, I cannot vouch,--of all our apostolic</line>
        <line>society, whose mission was to bless mankind, Hollingsworth, I</line>
        <line>apprehend, was the only one who began the enterprise with prayer. My</line>
        <line>sleeping-room being but thinly partitioned from his, the solemn murmur</line>
        <line>of his voice made its way to my ears, compelling me to be an auditor of</line>
        <line>his awful privacy with the Creator. It affected me with a deep</line>
        <line>reverence for Hollingsworth, which no familiarity then existing, or</line>
        <line>that afterwards grew more intimate between us,--no, nor my subsequent</line>
        <line>perception of his own great errors,--ever quite effaced. It is so rare,</line>
        <line>in these times, to meet with a man of prayerful habits (except, of</line>
        <line>course, in the pulpit), that such an one is decidedly marked out by the</line>
        <line>light of transfiguration, shed upon him in the divine interview from</line>
        <line>which he passes into his daily life.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As for me, I lay abed; and if I said my prayers, it was backward,</line>
        <line>cursing my day as bitterly as patient Job himself. The truth was, the</line>
        <line>hot-house warmth of a town residence, and the luxurious life in which I</line>
        <line>indulged myself, had taken much of the pith out of my physical system;</line>
        <line>and the wintry blast of the preceding day, together with the general</line>
        <line>chill of our airy old farmhouse, had got fairly into my heart and the</line>
        <line>marrow of my bones. In this predicament, I seriously wished--selfish</line>
        <line>as it may appear--that the reformation of society had been postponed</line>
        <line>about half a century, or, at all events, to such a date as should have</line>
        <line>put my intermeddling with it entirely out of the question.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>What, in the name of common-sense, had I to do with any better society</line>
        <line>than I had always lived in? It had satisfied me well enough. My</line>
        <line>pleasant bachelor-parlor, sunny and shadowy, curtained and carpeted,</line>
        <line>with the bedchamber adjoining; my centre-table, strewn with books and</line>
        <line>periodicals; my writing-desk with a half-finished poem, in a stanza of</line>
        <line>my own contrivance; my morning lounge at the reading-room or picture</line>
        <line>gallery; my noontide walk along the cheery pavement, with the</line>
        <line>suggestive succession of human faces, and the brisk throb of human life</line>
        <line>in which I shared; my dinner at the Albion, where I had a hundred</line>
        <line>dishes at command, and could banquet as delicately as the wizard</line>
        <line>Michael Scott when the Devil fed him from the king of France's kitchen;</line>
        <line>my evening at the billiard club, the concert, the theatre, or at</line>
        <line>somebody's party, if I pleased,--what could be better than all this?</line>
        <line>Was it better to hoe, to mow, to toil and moil amidst the accumulations</line>
        <line>of a barnyard; to be the chambermaid of two yoke of oxen and a dozen</line>
        <line>cows; to eat salt beef, and earn it with the sweat of my brow, and</line>
        <line>thereby take the tough morsel out of some wretch's mouth, into whose</line>
        <line>vocation I had thrust myself? Above all, was it better to have a fever</line>
        <line>and die blaspheming, as I was like to do?</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>In this wretched plight, with a furnace in my heart and another in my</line>
        <line>head, by the heat of which I was kept constantly at the boiling point,</line>
        <line>yet shivering at the bare idea of extruding so much as a finger into</line>
        <line>the icy atmosphere of the room, I kept my bed until breakfast-time,</line>
        <line>when Hollingsworth knocked at the door, and entered.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, Coverdale," cried he, "you bid fair to make an admirable farmer!</line>
        <line>Don't you mean to get up to-day?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Neither to-day nor to-morrow," said I hopelessly. "I doubt if I ever</line>
        <line>rise again!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What is the matter now?" he asked.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I told him my piteous case, and besought him to send me back to town in</line>
        <line>a close carriage.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No, no!" said Hollingsworth with kindly seriousness. "If you are</line>
        <line>really sick, we must take care of you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Accordingly he built a fire in my chamber, and, having little else to</line>
        <line>do while the snow lay on the ground, established himself as my nurse. A</line>
        <line>doctor was sent for, who, being homaeopathic, gave me as much medicine,</line>
        <line>in the course of a fortnight's attendance, as would have laid on the</line>
        <line>point of a needle. They fed me on water-gruel, and I speedily became a</line>
        <line>skeleton above ground. But, after all, I have many precious</line>
        <line>recollections connected with that fit of sickness.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hollingsworth's more than brotherly attendance gave me inexpressible</line>
        <line>comfort. Most men--and certainly I could not always claim to be one of</line>
        <line>the exceptions--have a natural indifference, if not an absolutely</line>
        <line>hostile feeling, towards those whom disease, or weakness, or calamity</line>
        <line>of any kind causes to falter and faint amid the rude jostle of our</line>
        <line>selfish existence. The education of Christianity, it is true, the</line>
        <line>sympathy of a like experience and the example of women, may soften and,</line>
        <line>possibly, subvert this ugly characteristic of our sex; but it is</line>
        <line>originally there, and has likewise its analogy in the practice of our</line>
        <line>brute brethren, who hunt the sick or disabled member of the herd from</line>
        <line>among them, as an enemy. It is for this reason that the stricken deer</line>
        <line>goes apart, and the sick lion grimly withdraws himself into his den.</line>
        <line>Except in love, or the attachments of kindred, or other very long and</line>
        <line>habitual affection, we really have no tenderness. But there was</line>
        <line>something of the woman moulded into the great, stalwart frame of</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth; nor was he ashamed of it, as men often are of what is</line>
        <line>best in them, nor seemed ever to know that there was such a soft place</line>
        <line>in his heart. I knew it well, however, at that time, although</line>
        <line>afterwards it came nigh to be forgotten. Methought there could not be</line>
        <line>two such men alive as Hollingsworth. There never was any blaze of a</line>
        <line>fireside that warmed and cheered me, in the down-sinkings and</line>
        <line>shiverings of my spirit, so effectually as did the light out of those</line>
        <line>eyes, which lay so deep and dark under his shaggy brows.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Happy the man that has such a friend beside him when he comes to die!</line>
        <line>and unless a friend like Hollingsworth be at hand,--as most probably</line>
        <line>there will not,--he had better make up his mind to die alone. How many</line>
        <line>men, I wonder, does one meet with in a lifetime, whom he would choose</line>
        <line>for his deathbed companions! At the crisis of my fever I besought</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth to let nobody else enter the room, but continually to</line>
        <line>make me sensible of his own presence by a grasp of the hand, a word, a</line>
        <line>prayer, if he thought good to utter it; and that then he should be the</line>
        <line>witness how courageously I would encounter the worst. It still</line>
        <line>impresses me as almost a matter of regret that I did not die then, when</line>
        <line>I had tolerably made up my mind to it; for Hollingsworth would have</line>
        <line>gone with me to the hither verge of life, and have sent his friendly</line>
        <line>and hopeful accents far over on the other side, while I should be</line>
        <line>treading the unknown path. Now, were I to send for him, he would</line>
        <line>hardly come to my bedside, nor should I depart the easier for his</line>
        <line>presence.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You are not going to die, this time," said he, gravely smiling. "You</line>
        <line>know nothing about sickness, and think your case a great deal more</line>
        <line>desperate than it is."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Death should take me while I am in the mood," replied I, with a little</line>
        <line>of my customary levity.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Have you nothing to do in life," asked Hollingsworth, "that you fancy</line>
        <line>yourself so ready to leave it?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Nothing," answered I; "nothing that I know of, unless to make pretty</line>
        <line>verses, and play a part, with Zenobia and the rest of the amateurs, in</line>
        <line>our pastoral. It seems but an unsubstantial sort of business, as</line>
        <line>viewed through a mist of fever. But, dear Hollingsworth, your own</line>
        <line>vocation is evidently to be a priest, and to spend your days and nights</line>
        <line>in helping your fellow creatures to draw peaceful dying breaths."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And by which of my qualities," inquired he, "can you suppose me fitted</line>
        <line>for this awful ministry?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"By your tenderness," I said. "It seems to me the reflection of God's</line>
        <line>own love."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And you call me tender!" repeated Hollingsworth thoughtfully. "I</line>
        <line>should rather say that the most marked trait in my character is an</line>
        <line>inflexible severity of purpose. Mortal man has no right to be so</line>
        <line>inflexible as it is my nature and necessity to be."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I do not believe it," I replied.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But, in due time, I remembered what he said.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Probably, as Hollingsworth suggested, my disorder was never so serious</line>
        <line>as, in my ignorance of such matters, I was inclined to consider it.</line>
        <line>After so much tragical preparation, it was positively rather mortifying</line>
        <line>to find myself on the mending hand.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>All the other members of the Community showed me kindness, according to</line>
        <line>the full measure of their capacity. Zenobia brought me my gruel every</line>
        <line>day, made by her own hands (not very skilfully, if the truth must be</line>
        <line>told), and, whenever I seemed inclined to converse, would sit by my</line>
        <line>bedside, and talk with so much vivacity as to add several gratuitous</line>
        <line>throbs to my pulse. Her poor little stories and tracts never half did</line>
        <line>justice to her intellect. It was only the lack of a fitter avenue that</line>
        <line>drove her to seek development in literature. She was made (among a</line>
        <line>thousand other things that she might have been) for a stump oratress.</line>
        <line>I recognized no severe culture in Zenobia; her mind was full of weeds.</line>
        <line>It startled me sometimes, in my state of moral as well as bodily</line>
        <line>faint-heartedness, to observe the hardihood of her philosophy. She</line>
        <line>made no scruple of oversetting all human institutions, and scattering</line>
        <line>them as with a breeze from her fan. A female reformer, in her attacks</line>
        <line>upon society, has an instinctive sense of where the life lies, and is</line>
        <line>inclined to aim directly at that spot. Especially the relation between</line>
        <line>the sexes is naturally among the earliest to attract her notice.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia was truly a magnificent woman. The homely simplicity of her</line>
        <line>dress could not conceal, nor scarcely diminish, the queenliness of her</line>
        <line>presence. The image of her form and face should have been multiplied</line>
        <line>all over the earth. It was wronging the rest of mankind to retain her</line>
        <line>as the spectacle of only a few. The stage would have been her proper</line>
        <line>sphere. She should have made it a point of duty, moreover, to sit</line>
        <line>endlessly to painters and sculptors, and preferably to the latter;</line>
        <line>because the cold decorum of the marble would consist with the utmost</line>
        <line>scantiness of drapery, so that the eye might chastely be gladdened with</line>
        <line>her material perfection in its entireness. I know not well how to</line>
        <line>express that the native glow of coloring in her cheeks, and even the</line>
        <line>flesh-warmth over her round arms, and what was visible of her full</line>
        <line>bust,--in a word, her womanliness incarnated,--compelled me sometimes</line>
        <line>to close my eyes, as if it were not quite the privilege of modesty to</line>
        <line>gaze at her. Illness and exhaustion, no doubt, had made me morbidly</line>
        <line>sensitive.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I noticed--and wondered how Zenobia contrived it--that she had always a</line>
        <line>new flower in her hair. And still it was a hot-house flower,--an</line>
        <line>outlandish flower,--a flower of the tropics, such as appeared to have</line>
        <line>sprung passionately out of a soil the very weeds of which would be</line>
        <line>fervid and spicy. Unlike as was the flower of each successive day to</line>
        <line>the preceding one, it yet so assimilated its richness to the rich</line>
        <line>beauty of the woman, that I thought it the only flower fit to be worn;</line>
        <line>so fit, indeed, that Nature had evidently created this floral gem, in a</line>
        <line>happy exuberance, for the one purpose of worthily adorning Zenobia's</line>
        <line>head. It might be that my feverish fantasies clustered themselves</line>
        <line>about this peculiarity, and caused it to look more gorgeous and</line>
        <line>wonderful than if beheld with temperate eyes. In the height of my</line>
        <line>illness, as I well recollect, I went so far as to pronounce it</line>
        <line>preternatural.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Zenobia is an enchantress!" whispered I once to Hollingsworth. "She</line>
        <line>is a sister of the Veiled Lady. That flower in her hair is a talisman.</line>
        <line>If you were to snatch it away, she would vanish, or be transformed into</line>
        <line>something else."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What does he say?" asked Zenobia.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Nothing that has an atom of sense in it," answered Hollingsworth. "He</line>
        <line>is a little beside himself, I believe, and talks about your being a</line>
        <line>witch, and of some magical property in the flower that you wear in your</line>
        <line>hair."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It is an idea worthy of a feverish poet," said she, laughing rather</line>
        <line>compassionately, and taking out the flower. "I scorn to owe anything</line>
        <line>to magic. Here, Mr. Hollingsworth, you may keep the spell while it has</line>
        <line>any virtue in it; but I cannot promise you not to appear with a new one</line>
        <line>to-morrow. It is the one relic of my more brilliant, my happier days!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The most curious part of the matter was that, long after my slight</line>
        <line>delirium had passed away,--as long, indeed, as I continued to know this</line>
        <line>remarkable woman,--her daily flower affected my imagination, though</line>
        <line>more slightly, yet in very much the same way. The reason must have</line>
        <line>been that, whether intentionally on her part or not, this favorite</line>
        <line>ornament was actually a subtile expression of Zenobia's character.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>One subject, about which--very impertinently, moreover--I perplexed</line>
        <line>myself with a great many conjectures, was, whether Zenobia had ever</line>
        <line>been married. The idea, it must be understood, was unauthorized by any</line>
        <line>circumstance or suggestion that had made its way to my ears. So young</line>
        <line>as I beheld her, and the freshest and rosiest woman of a thousand,</line>
        <line>there was certainly no need of imputing to her a destiny already</line>
        <line>accomplished; the probability was far greater that her coming years had</line>
        <line>all life's richest gifts to bring. If the great event of a woman's</line>
        <line>existence had been consummated, the world knew nothing of it, although</line>
        <line>the world seemed to know Zenobia well. It was a ridiculous piece of</line>
        <line>romance, undoubtedly, to imagine that this beautiful personage, wealthy</line>
        <line>as she was, and holding a position that might fairly enough be called</line>
        <line>distinguished, could have given herself away so privately, but that</line>
        <line>some whisper and suspicion, and by degrees a full understanding of the</line>
        <line>fact, would eventually be blown abroad. But then, as I failed not to</line>
        <line>consider, her original home was at a distance of many hundred miles.</line>
        <line>Rumors might fill the social atmosphere, or might once have filled it,</line>
        <line>there, which would travel but slowly, against the wind, towards our</line>
        <line>Northeastern metropolis, and perhaps melt into thin air before reaching</line>
        <line>it.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There was not--and I distinctly repeat it--the slightest foundation in</line>
        <line>my knowledge for any surmise of the kind. But there is a species of</line>
        <line>intuition,--either a spiritual lie or the subtile recognition of a</line>
        <line>fact,--which comes to us in a reduced state of the corporeal system.</line>
        <line>The soul gets the better of the body, after wasting illness, or when a</line>
        <line>vegetable diet may have mingled too much ether in the blood. Vapors</line>
        <line>then rise up to the brain, and take shapes that often image falsehood,</line>
        <line>but sometimes truth. The spheres of our companions have, at such</line>
        <line>periods, a vastly greater influence upon our own than when robust</line>
        <line>health gives us a repellent and self-defensive energy. Zenobia's</line>
        <line>sphere, I imagine, impressed itself powerfully on mine, and transformed</line>
        <line>me, during this period of my weakness, into something like a mesmerical</line>
        <line>clairvoyant.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Then, also, as anybody could observe, the freedom of her deportment</line>
        <line>(though, to some tastes, it might commend itself as the utmost</line>
        <line>perfection of manner in a youthful widow or a blooming matron) was not</line>
        <line>exactly maiden-like. What girl had ever laughed as Zenobia did? What</line>
        <line>girl had ever spoken in her mellow tones? Her unconstrained and</line>
        <line>inevitable manifestation, I said often to myself, was that of a woman</line>
        <line>to whom wedlock had thrown wide the gates of mystery. Yet sometimes I</line>
        <line>strove to be ashamed of these conjectures. I acknowledged it as a</line>
        <line>masculine grossness--a sin of wicked interpretation, of which man is</line>
        <line>often guilty towards the other sex--thus to mistake the sweet, liberal,</line>
        <line>but womanly frankness of a noble and generous disposition. Still, it</line>
        <line>was of no avail to reason with myself nor to upbraid myself.</line>
        <line>Pertinaciously the thought, "Zenobia is a wife; Zenobia has lived and</line>
        <line>loved! There is no folded petal, no latent dewdrop, in this perfectly</line>
        <line>developed rose!"--irresistibly that thought drove out all other</line>
        <line>conclusions, as often as my mind reverted to the subject.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia was conscious of my observation, though not, I presume, of the</line>
        <line>point to which it led me.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Mr. Coverdale," said she one day, as she saw me watching her, while</line>
        <line>she arranged my gruel on the table, "I have been exposed to a great</line>
        <line>deal of eye-shot in the few years of my mixing in the world, but never,</line>
        <line>I think, to precisely such glances as you are in the habit of favoring</line>
        <line>me with. I seem to interest you very much; and yet--or else a woman's</line>
        <line>instinct is for once deceived--I cannot reckon you as an admirer. What</line>
        <line>are you seeking to discover in me?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"The mystery of your life," answered I, surprised into the truth by the</line>
        <line>unexpectedness of her attack. "And you will never tell me."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She bent her head towards me, and let me look into her eyes, as if</line>
        <line>challenging me to drop a plummet-line down into the depths of her</line>
        <line>consciousness.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I see nothing now," said I, closing my own eyes, "unless it be the</line>
        <line>face of a sprite laughing at me from the bottom of a deep well."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>A bachelor always feels himself defrauded, when he knows or suspects</line>
        <line>that any woman of his acquaintance has given herself away. Otherwise,</line>
        <line>the matter could have been no concern of mine. It was purely</line>
        <line>speculative, for I should not, under any circumstances, have fallen in</line>
        <line>love with Zenobia. The riddle made me so nervous, however, in my</line>
        <line>sensitive condition of mind and body, that I most ungratefully began to</line>
        <line>wish that she would let me alone. Then, too, her gruel was very</line>
        <line>wretched stuff, with almost invariably the smell of pine smoke upon it,</line>
        <line>like the evil taste that is said to mix itself up with a witch's best</line>
        <line>concocted dainties. Why could not she have allowed one of the other</line>
        <line>women to take the gruel in charge? Whatever else might be her gifts,</line>
        <line>Nature certainly never intended Zenobia for a cook. Or, if so, she</line>
        <line>should have meddled only with the richest and spiciest dishes, and such</line>
        <line>as are to be tasted at banquets, between draughts of intoxicating wine.</line>
    </p>

    <p>
        <title>THE CONVALESCENT</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As soon as my incommodities allowed me to think of past occurrences, I</line>
        <line>failed not to inquire what had become of the odd little guest whom</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth had been the medium of introducing among us. It now</line>
        <line>appeared that poor Priscilla had not so literally fallen out of the</line>
        <line>clouds, as we were at first inclined to suppose. A letter, which</line>
        <line>should have introduced her, had since been received from one of the</line>
        <line>city missionaries, containing a certificate of character and an</line>
        <line>allusion to circumstances which, in the writer's judgment, made it</line>
        <line>especially desirable that she should find shelter in our Community.</line>
        <line>There was a hint, not very intelligible, implying either that Priscilla</line>
        <line>had recently escaped from some particular peril or irksomeness of</line>
        <line>position, or else that she was still liable to this danger or</line>
        <line>difficulty, whatever it might be. We should ill have deserved the</line>
        <line>reputation of a benevolent fraternity, had we hesitated to entertain a</line>
        <line>petitioner in such need, and so strongly recommended to our kindness;</line>
        <line>not to mention, moreover, that the strange maiden had set herself</line>
        <line>diligently to work, and was doing good service with her needle. But a</line>
        <line>slight mist of uncertainty still floated about Priscilla, and kept her,</line>
        <line>as yet, from taking a very decided place among creatures of flesh and</line>
        <line>blood.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The mysterious attraction, which, from her first entrance on our scene,</line>
        <line>she evinced for Zenobia, had lost nothing of its force. I often heard</line>
        <line>her footsteps, soft and low, accompanying the light but decided tread</line>
        <line>of the latter up the staircase, stealing along the passage-way by her</line>
        <line>new friend's side, and pausing while Zenobia entered my chamber.</line>
        <line>Occasionally Zenobia would be a little annoyed by Priscilla's too close</line>
        <line>attendance. In an authoritative and not very kindly tone, she would</line>
        <line>advise her to breathe the pleasant air in a walk, or to go with her</line>
        <line>work into the barn, holding out half a promise to come and sit on the</line>
        <line>hay with her, when at leisure. Evidently, Priscilla found but scanty</line>
        <line>requital for her love. Hollingsworth was likewise a great favorite with</line>
        <line>her. For several minutes together sometimes, while my auditory nerves</line>
        <line>retained the susceptibility of delicate health, I used to hear a low,</line>
        <line>pleasant murmur ascending from the room below; and at last ascertained</line>
        <line>it to be Priscilla's voice, babbling like a little brook to</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth. She talked more largely and freely with him than with</line>
        <line>Zenobia, towards whom, indeed, her feelings seemed not so much to be</line>
        <line>confidence as involuntary affection. I should have thought all the</line>
        <line>better of my own qualities had Priscilla marked me out for the third</line>
        <line>place in her regards. But, though she appeared to like me tolerably</line>
        <line>well, I could never flatter myself with being distinguished by her as</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth and Zenobia were.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>One forenoon, during my convalescence, there came a gentle tap at my</line>
        <line>chamber door. I immediately said, "Come in, Priscilla!" with an acute</line>
        <line>sense of the applicant's identity. Nor was I deceived. It was really</line>
        <line>Priscilla,--a pale, large-eyed little woman (for she had gone far</line>
        <line>enough into her teens to be, at least, on the outer limit of girlhood),</line>
        <line>but much less wan than at my previous view of her, and far better</line>
        <line>conditioned both as to health and spirits. As I first saw her, she had</line>
        <line>reminded me of plants that one sometimes observes doing their best to</line>
        <line>vegetate among the bricks of an enclosed court, where there is scanty</line>
        <line>soil and never any sunshine. At present, though with no approach to</line>
        <line>bloom, there were indications that the girl had human blood in her</line>
        <line>veins.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Priscilla came softly to my bedside, and held out an article of</line>
        <line>snow-white linen, very carefully and smoothly ironed. She did not seem</line>
        <line>bashful, nor anywise embarrassed. My weakly condition, I suppose,</line>
        <line>supplied a medium in which she could approach me.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Do not you need this?" asked she. "I have made it for you." It was a</line>
        <line>nightcap!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"My dear Priscilla," said I, smiling, "I never had on a nightcap in my</line>
        <line>life! But perhaps it will be better for me to wear one, now that I am</line>
        <line>a miserable invalid. How admirably you have done it! No, no; I never</line>
        <line>can think of wearing such an exquisitely wrought nightcap as this,</line>
        <line>unless it be in the daytime, when I sit up to receive company."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It is for use, not beauty," answered Priscilla. "I could have</line>
        <line>embroidered it and made it much prettier, if I pleased."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>While holding up the nightcap and admiring the fine needlework, I</line>
        <line>perceived that Priscilla had a sealed letter which she was waiting for</line>
        <line>me to take. It had arrived from the village post-office that morning.</line>
        <line>As I did not immediately offer to receive the letter, she drew it back,</line>
        <line>and held it against her bosom, with both hands clasped over it, in a</line>
        <line>way that had probably grown habitual to her. Now, on turning my eyes</line>
        <line>from the nightcap to Priscilla, it forcibly struck me that her air,</line>
        <line>though not her figure, and the expression of her face, but not its</line>
        <line>features, had a resemblance to what I had often seen in a friend of</line>
        <line>mine, one of the most gifted women of the age. I cannot describe it.</line>
        <line>The points easiest to convey to the reader were a certain curve of the</line>
        <line>shoulders and a partial closing of the eyes, which seemed to look more</line>
        <line>penetratingly into my own eyes, through the narrowed apertures, than if</line>
        <line>they had been open at full width. It was a singular anomaly of</line>
        <line>likeness coexisting with perfect dissimilitude.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Will you give me the letter, Priscilla?" said I.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She started, put the letter into my hand, and quite lost the look that</line>
        <line>had drawn my notice.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Priscilla," I inquired, "did you ever see Miss Margaret Fuller?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No," she answered.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Because," said I, "you reminded me of her just now,--and it happens,</line>
        <line>strangely enough, that this very letter is from her."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Priscilla, for whatever reason, looked very much discomposed.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I wish people would not fancy such odd things in me!" she said rather</line>
        <line>petulantly. "How could I possibly make myself resemble this lady</line>
        <line>merely by holding her letter in my hand?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Certainly, Priscilla, it would puzzle me to explain it," I replied;</line>
        <line>"nor do I suppose that the letter had anything to do with it. It was</line>
        <line>just a coincidence, nothing more."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She hastened out of the room, and this was the last that I saw of</line>
        <line>Priscilla until I ceased to be an invalid.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Being much alone during my recovery, I read interminably in Mr.</line>
        <line>Emerson's Essays, "The Dial," Carlyle's works, George Sand's romances</line>
        <line>(lent me by Zenobia), and other books which one or another of the</line>
        <line>brethren or sisterhood had brought with them. Agreeing in little else,</line>
        <line>most of these utterances were like the cry of some solitary sentinel,</line>
        <line>whose station was on the outposts of the advance guard of human</line>
        <line>progression; or sometimes the voice came sadly from among the shattered</line>
        <line>ruins of the past, but yet had a hopeful echo in the future. They were</line>
        <line>well adapted (better, at least, than any other intellectual products,</line>
        <line>the volatile essence of which had heretofore tinctured a printed page)</line>
        <line>to pilgrims like ourselves, whose present bivouac was considerably</line>
        <line>further into the waste of chaos than any mortal army of crusaders had</line>
        <line>ever marched before. Fourier's works, also, in a series of horribly</line>
        <line>tedious volumes, attracted a good deal of my attention, from the</line>
        <line>analogy which I could not but recognize between his system and our own.</line>
        <line>There was far less resemblance, it is true, than the world chose to</line>
        <line>imagine, inasmuch as the two theories differed, as widely as the zenith</line>
        <line>from the nadir, in their main principles.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I talked about Fourier to Hollingsworth, and translated, for his</line>
        <line>benefit, some of the passages that chiefly impressed me.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"When, as a consequence of human improvement," said I, "the globe shall</line>
        <line>arrive at its final perfection, the great ocean is to be converted into</line>
        <line>a particular kind of lemonade, such as was fashionable at Paris in</line>
        <line>Fourier's time. He calls it limonade a cedre. It is positively a</line>
        <line>fact! Just imagine the city docks filled, every day, with a flood tide</line>
        <line>of this delectable beverage!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Why did not the Frenchman make punch of it at once?" asked</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth. "The jack-tars would be delighted to go down in ships</line>
        <line>and do business in such an element."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I further proceeded to explain, as well as I modestly could, several</line>
        <line>points of Fourier's system, illustrating them with here and there a</line>
        <line>page or two, and asking Hollingsworth's opinion as to the expediency of</line>
        <line>introducing these beautiful peculiarities into our own practice.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Let me hear no more of it!" cried he, in utter disgust. "I never will</line>
        <line>forgive this fellow! He has committed the unpardonable sin; for what</line>
        <line>more monstrous iniquity could the Devil himself contrive than to choose</line>
        <line>the selfish principle,--the principle of all human wrong, the very</line>
        <line>blackness of man's heart, the portion of ourselves which we shudder at,</line>
        <line>and which it is the whole aim of spiritual discipline to eradicate,--to</line>
        <line>choose it as the master workman of his system? To seize upon and</line>
        <line>foster whatever vile, petty, sordid, filthy, bestial, and abominable</line>
        <line>corruptions have cankered into our nature, to be the efficient</line>
        <line>instruments of his infernal regeneration! And his consummated</line>
        <line>Paradise, as he pictures it, would be worthy of the agency which he</line>
        <line>counts upon for establishing it. The nauseous villain!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Nevertheless," remarked I, "in consideration of the promised delights</line>
        <line>of his system,--so very proper, as they certainly are, to be</line>
        <line>appreciated by Fourier's countrymen,--I cannot but wonder that</line>
        <line>universal France did not adopt his theory at a moment's warning. But</line>
        <line>is there not something very characteristic of his nation in Fourier's</line>
        <line>manner of putting forth his views? He makes no claim to inspiration.</line>
        <line>He has not persuaded himself--as Swedenborg did, and as any other than</line>
        <line>a Frenchman would, with a mission of like importance to</line>
        <line>communicate--that he speaks with authority from above. He promulgates</line>
        <line>his system, so far as I can perceive, entirely on his own</line>
        <line>responsibility. He has searched out and discovered the whole counsel</line>
        <line>of the Almighty in respect to mankind, past, present, and for exactly</line>
        <line>seventy thousand years to come, by the mere force and cunning of his</line>
        <line>individual intellect!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Take the book out of my sight," said Hollingsworth with great</line>
        <line>virulence of expression, "or, I tell you fairly, I shall fling it in</line>
        <line>the fire! And as for Fourier, let him make a Paradise, if he can, of</line>
        <line>Gehenna, where, as I conscientiously believe, he is floundering at this</line>
        <line>moment!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And bellowing, I suppose," said I,--not that I felt any ill-will</line>
        <line>towards Fourier, but merely wanted to give the finishing touch to</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's image, "bellowing for the least drop of his beloved</line>
        <line>limonade a cedre!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There is but little profit to be expected in attempting to argue with a</line>
        <line>man who allows himself to declaim in this manner; so I dropt the</line>
        <line>subject, and never took it up again.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But had the system at which he was so enraged combined almost any</line>
        <line>amount of human wisdom, spiritual insight, and imaginative beauty, I</line>
        <line>question whether Hollingsworth's mind was in a fit condition to receive</line>
        <line>it. I began to discern that he had come among us actuated by no real</line>
        <line>sympathy with our feelings and our hopes, but chiefly because we were</line>
        <line>estranging ourselves from the world, with which his lonely and</line>
        <line>exclusive object in life had already put him at odds. Hollingsworth</line>
        <line>must have been originally endowed with a great spirit of benevolence,</line>
        <line>deep enough and warm enough to be the source of as much disinterested</line>
        <line>good as Providence often allows a human being the privilege of</line>
        <line>conferring upon his fellows. This native instinct yet lived within</line>
        <line>him. I myself had profited by it, in my necessity. It was seen, too,</line>
        <line>in his treatment of Priscilla. Such casual circumstances as were here</line>
        <line>involved would quicken his divine power of sympathy, and make him seem,</line>
        <line>while their influence lasted, the tenderest man and the truest friend</line>
        <line>on earth. But by and by you missed the tenderness of yesterday, and</line>
        <line>grew drearily conscious that Hollingsworth had a closer friend than</line>
        <line>ever you could be; and this friend was the cold, spectral monster which</line>
        <line>he had himself conjured up, and on which he was wasting all the warmth</line>
        <line>of his heart, and of which, at last,--as these men of a mighty purpose</line>
        <line>so invariably do,--he had grown to be the bond-slave. It was his</line>
        <line>philanthropic theory.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>This was a result exceedingly sad to contemplate, considering that it</line>
        <line>had been mainly brought about by the very ardor and exuberance of his</line>
        <line>philanthropy. Sad, indeed, but by no means unusual: he had taught his</line>
        <line>benevolence to pour its warm tide exclusively through one channel; so</line>
        <line>that there was nothing to spare for other great manifestations of love</line>
        <line>to man, nor scarcely for the nutriment of individual attachments,</line>
        <line>unless they could minister in some way to the terrible egotism which he</line>
        <line>mistook for an angel of God. Had Hollingsworth's education been more</line>
        <line>enlarged, he might not so inevitably have stumbled into this pitfall.</line>
        <line>But this identical pursuit had educated him. He knew absolutely</line>
        <line>nothing, except in a single direction, where he had thought so</line>
        <line>energetically, and felt to such a depth, that no doubt the entire</line>
        <line>reason and justice of the universe appeared to be concentrated</line>
        <line>thitherward.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It is my private opinion that, at this period of his life,</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth was fast going mad; and, as with other crazy people</line>
        <line>(among whom I include humorists of every degree), it required all the</line>
        <line>constancy of friendship to restrain his associates from pronouncing him</line>
        <line>an intolerable bore. Such prolonged fiddling upon one string--such</line>
        <line>multiform presentation of one idea! His specific object (of which he</line>
        <line>made the public more than sufficiently aware, through the medium of</line>
        <line>lectures and pamphlets) was to obtain funds for the construction of an</line>
        <line>edifice, with a sort of collegiate endowment. On this foundation he</line>
        <line>purposed to devote himself and a few disciples to the reform and mental</line>
        <line>culture of our criminal brethren. His visionary edifice was</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's one castle in the air; it was the material type in</line>
        <line>which his philanthropic dream strove to embody itself; and he made the</line>
        <line>scheme more definite, and caught hold of it the more strongly, and kept</line>
        <line>his clutch the more pertinaciously, by rendering it visible to the</line>
        <line>bodily eye. I have seen him, a hundred times, with a pencil and sheet</line>
        <line>of paper, sketching the facade, the side-view, or the rear of the</line>
        <line>structure, or planning the internal arrangements, as lovingly as</line>
        <line>another man might plan those of the projected home where he meant to be</line>
        <line>happy with his wife and children. I have known him to begin a model of</line>
        <line>the building with little stones, gathered at the brookside, whither we</line>
        <line>had gone to cool ourselves in the sultry noon of haying-time. Unlike</line>
        <line>all other ghosts, his spirit haunted an edifice, which, instead of</line>
        <line>being time-worn, and full of storied love, and joy, and sorrow, had</line>
        <line>never yet come into existence.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Dear friend," said I once to Hollingsworth, before leaving my</line>
        <line>sick-chamber, "I heartily wish that I could make your schemes my</line>
        <line>schemes, because it would be so great a happiness to find myself</line>
        <line>treading the same path with you. But I am afraid there is not stuff in</line>
        <line>me stern enough for a philanthropist,--or not in this peculiar</line>
        <line>direction,--or, at all events, not solely in this. Can you bear with</line>
        <line>me, if such should prove to be the case?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I will at least wait awhile," answered Hollingsworth, gazing at me</line>
        <line>sternly and gloomily. "But how can you be my life-long friend, except</line>
        <line>you strive with me towards the great object of my life?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Heaven forgive me! A horrible suspicion crept into my heart, and stung</line>
        <line>the very core of it as with the fangs of an adder. I wondered whether</line>
        <line>it were possible that Hollingsworth could have watched by my bedside,</line>
        <line>with all that devoted care, only for the ulterior purpose of making me</line>
        <line>a proselyte to his views!</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>A MODERN ARCADIA</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>May-day--I forget whether by Zenobia's sole decree, or by the unanimous</line>
        <line>vote of our community--had been declared a movable festival. It was</line>
        <line>deferred until the sun should have had a reasonable time to clear away</line>
        <line>the snowdrifts along the lee of the stone walls, and bring out a few of</line>
        <line>the readiest wild flowers. On the forenoon of the substituted day,</line>
        <line>after admitting some of the balmy air into my chamber, I decided that</line>
        <line>it was nonsense and effeminacy to keep myself a prisoner any longer.</line>
        <line>So I descended to the sitting-room, and finding nobody there, proceeded</line>
        <line>to the barn, whence I had already heard Zenobia's voice, and along with</line>
        <line>it a girlish laugh which was not so certainly recognizable. Arriving</line>
        <line>at the spot, it a little surprised me to discover that these merry</line>
        <line>outbreaks came from Priscilla.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The two had been a-maying together. They had found anemones in</line>
        <line>abundance, houstonias by the handful, some columbines, a few</line>
        <line>long-stalked violets, and a quantity of white everlasting flowers, and</line>
        <line>had filled up their basket with the delicate spray of shrubs and trees.</line>
        <line>None were prettier than the maple twigs, the leaf of which looks like a</line>
        <line>scarlet bud in May, and like a plate of vegetable gold in October.</line>
        <line>Zenobia, who showed no conscience in such matters, had also rifled a</line>
        <line>cherry-tree of one of its blossomed boughs, and, with all this variety</line>
        <line>of sylvan ornament, had been decking out Priscilla. Being done with a</line>
        <line>good deal of taste, it made her look more charming than I should have</line>
        <line>thought possible, with my recollection of the wan, frost-nipt girl, as</line>
        <line>heretofore described. Nevertheless, among those fragrant blossoms, and</line>
        <line>conspicuously, too, had been stuck a weed of evil odor and ugly aspect,</line>
        <line>which, as soon as I detected it, destroyed the effect of all the rest.</line>
        <line>There was a gleam of latent mischief--not to call it deviltry--in</line>
        <line>Zenobia's eye, which seemed to indicate a slightly malicious purpose in</line>
        <line>the arrangement.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As for herself, she scorned the rural buds and leaflets, and wore</line>
        <line>nothing but her invariable flower of the tropics.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What do you think of Priscilla now, Mr. Coverdale?" asked she,</line>
        <line>surveying her as a child does its doll. "Is not she worth a verse or</line>
        <line>two?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"There is only one thing amiss," answered Zenobia laughed, and flung</line>
        <line>the malignant weed away.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Yes; she deserves some verses now," said I, "and from a better poet</line>
        <line>than myself. She is the very picture of the New England spring;</line>
        <line>subdued in tint and rather cool, but with a capacity of sunshine, and</line>
        <line>bringing us a few Alpine blossoms, as earnest of something richer,</line>
        <line>though hardly more beautiful, hereafter. The best type of her is one</line>
        <line>of those anemones."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What I find most singular in Priscilla, as her health improves,"</line>
        <line>observed Zenobia, "is her wildness. Such a quiet little body as she</line>
        <line>seemed, one would not have expected that. Why, as we strolled the</line>
        <line>woods together, I could hardly keep her from scrambling up the trees,</line>
        <line>like a squirrel. She has never before known what it is to live in the</line>
        <line>free air, and so it intoxicates her as if she were sipping wine. And</line>
        <line>she thinks it such a paradise here, and all of us, particularly Mr.</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth and myself, such angels! It is quite ridiculous, and</line>
        <line>provokes one's malice almost, to see a creature so happy, especially a</line>
        <line>feminine creature."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"They are always happier than male creatures," said I.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You must correct that opinion, Mr. Coverdale," replied Zenobia</line>
        <line>contemptuously, "or I shall think you lack the poetic insight. Did you</line>
        <line>ever see a happy woman in your life? Of course, I do not mean a girl,</line>
        <line>like Priscilla and a thousand others,--for they are all alike, while on</line>
        <line>the sunny side of experience,--but a grown woman. How can she be</line>
        <line>happy, after discovering that fate has assigned her but one single</line>
        <line>event, which she must contrive to make the substance of her whole life?</line>
        <line>A man has his choice of innumerable events."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"A woman, I suppose," answered I, "by constant repetition of her one</line>
        <line>event, may compensate for the lack of variety."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Indeed!" said Zenobia.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>While we were talking, Priscilla caught sight of Hollingsworth at a</line>
        <line>distance, in a blue frock, and with a hoe over his shoulder, returning</line>
        <line>from the field. She immediately set out to meet him, running and</line>
        <line>skipping, with spirits as light as the breeze of the May morning, but</line>
        <line>with limbs too little exercised to be quite responsive; she clapped her</line>
        <line>hands, too, with great exuberance of gesture, as is the custom of young</line>
        <line>girls when their electricity overcharges them. But, all at once, midway</line>
        <line>to Hollingsworth, she paused, looked round about her, towards the</line>
        <line>river, the road, the woods, and back towards us, appearing to listen,</line>
        <line>as if she heard some one calling her name, and knew not precisely in</line>
        <line>what direction.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Have you bewitched her?" I exclaimed.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It is no sorcery of mine," said Zenobia; "but I have seen the girl do</line>
        <line>that identical thing once or twice before. Can you imagine what is the</line>
        <line>matter with her?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No; unless," said I, "she has the gift of hearing those 'airy tongues</line>
        <line>that syllable men's names,' which Milton tells about."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>From whatever cause, Priscilla's animation seemed entirely to have</line>
        <line>deserted her. She seated herself on a rock, and remained there until</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth came up; and when he took her hand and led her back to</line>
        <line>us, she rather resembled my original image of the wan and spiritless</line>
        <line>Priscilla than the flowery May-queen of a few moments ago. These</line>
        <line>sudden transformations, only to be accounted for by an extreme nervous</line>
        <line>susceptibility, always continued to characterize the girl, though with</line>
        <line>diminished frequency as her health progressively grew more robust.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I was now on my legs again. My fit of illness had been an avenue</line>
        <line>between two existences; the low-arched and darksome doorway, through</line>
        <line>which I crept out of a life of old conventionalisms, on my hands and</line>
        <line>knees, as it were, and gained admittance into the freer region that lay</line>
        <line>beyond. In this respect, it was like death. And, as with death, too,</line>
        <line>it was good to have gone through it. No otherwise could I have rid</line>
        <line>myself of a thousand follies, fripperies, prejudices, habits, and other</line>
        <line>such worldly dust as inevitably settles upon the crowd along the broad</line>
        <line>highway, giving them all one sordid aspect before noon-time, however</line>
        <line>freshly they may have begun their pilgrimage in the dewy morning. The</line>
        <line>very substance upon my bones had not been fit to live with in any</line>
        <line>better, truer, or more energetic mode than that to which I was</line>
        <line>accustomed. So it was taken off me and flung aside, like any other</line>
        <line>worn-out or unseasonable garment; and, after shivering a little while</line>
        <line>in my skeleton, I began to be clothed anew, and much more</line>
        <line>satisfactorily than in my previous suit. In literal and physical</line>
        <line>truth, I was quite another man. I had a lively sense of the exultation</line>
        <line>with which the spirit will enter on the next stage of its eternal</line>
        <line>progress after leaving the heavy burden of its mortality in an early</line>
        <line>grave, with as little concern for what may become of it as now affected</line>
        <line>me for the flesh which I had lost.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Emerging into the genial sunshine, I half fancied that the labors of</line>
        <line>the brotherhood had already realized some of Fourier's predictions.</line>
        <line>Their enlightened culture of the soil, and the virtues with which they</line>
        <line>sanctified their life, had begun to produce an effect upon the material</line>
        <line>world and its climate. In my new enthusiasm, man looked strong and</line>
        <line>stately,--and woman, oh, how beautiful!--and the earth a green garden,</line>
        <line>blossoming with many-colored delights. Thus Nature, whose laws I had</line>
        <line>broken in various artificial ways, comported herself towards me as a</line>
        <line>strict but loving mother, who uses the rod upon her little boy for his</line>
        <line>naughtiness, and then gives him a smile, a kiss, and some pretty</line>
        <line>playthings to console the urchin for her severity.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>In the interval of my seclusion, there had been a number of recruits to</line>
        <line>our little army of saints and martyrs. They were mostly individuals</line>
        <line>who had gone through such an experience as to disgust them with</line>
        <line>ordinary pursuits, but who were not yet so old, nor had suffered so</line>
        <line>deeply, as to lose their faith in the better time to come. On comparing</line>
        <line>their minds one with another they often discovered that this idea of a</line>
        <line>Community had been growing up, in silent and unknown sympathy, for</line>
        <line>years. Thoughtful, strongly lined faces were among them; sombre brows,</line>
        <line>but eyes that did not require spectacles, unless prematurely dimmed by</line>
        <line>the student's lamplight, and hair that seldom showed a thread of</line>
        <line>silver. Age, wedded to the past, incrusted over with a stony layer of</line>
        <line>habits, and retaining nothing fluid in its possibilities, would have</line>
        <line>been absurdly out of place in an enterprise like this. Youth, too, in</line>
        <line>its early dawn, was hardly more adapted to our purpose; for it would</line>
        <line>behold the morning radiance of its own spirit beaming over the very</line>
        <line>same spots of withered grass and barren sand whence most of us had seen</line>
        <line>it vanish. We had very young people with us, it is true,--downy lads,</line>
        <line>rosy girls in their first teens, and children of all heights above</line>
        <line>one's knee; but these had chiefly been sent hither for education, which</line>
        <line>it was one of the objects and methods of our institution to supply.</line>
        <line>Then we had boarders, from town and elsewhere, who lived with us in a</line>
        <line>familiar way, sympathized more or less in our theories, and sometimes</line>
        <line>shared in our labors.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>On the whole, it was a society such as has seldom met together; nor,</line>
        <line>perhaps, could it reasonably be expected to hold together long. Persons</line>
        <line>of marked individuality--crooked sticks, as some of us might be</line>
        <line>called--are not exactly the easiest to bind up into a fagot. But, so</line>
        <line>long as our union should subsist, a man of intellect and feeling, with</line>
        <line>a free nature in him, might have sought far and near without finding so</line>
        <line>many points of attraction as would allure him hitherward. We were of</line>
        <line>all creeds and opinions, and generally tolerant of all, on every</line>
        <line>imaginable subject. Our bond, it seems to me, was not affirmative, but</line>
        <line>negative. We had individually found one thing or another to quarrel</line>
        <line>with in our past life, and were pretty well agreed as to the</line>
        <line>inexpediency of lumbering along with the old system any further. As to</line>
        <line>what should be substituted, there was much less unanimity. We did not</line>
        <line>greatly care--at least, I never did--for the written constitution under</line>
        <line>which our millennium had commenced. My hope was, that, between theory</line>
        <line>and practice, a true and available mode of life might be struck out;</line>
        <line>and that, even should we ultimately fail, the months or years spent in</line>
        <line>the trial would not have been wasted, either as regarded passing</line>
        <line>enjoyment, or the experience which makes men wise.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Arcadians though we were, our costume bore no resemblance to the</line>
        <line>beribboned doublets, silk breeches and stockings, and slippers fastened</line>
        <line>with artificial roses, that distinguish the pastoral people of poetry</line>
        <line>and the stage. In outward show, I humbly conceive, we looked rather</line>
        <line>like a gang of beggars, or banditti, than either a company of honest</line>
        <line>laboring-men, or a conclave of philosophers. Whatever might be our</line>
        <line>points of difference, we all of us seemed to have come to Blithedale</line>
        <line>with the one thrifty and laudable idea of wearing out our old clothes.</line>
        <line>Such garments as had an airing, whenever we strode afield! Coats with</line>
        <line>high collars and with no collars, broad-skirted or swallow-tailed, and</line>
        <line>with the waist at every point between the hip and arm-pit; pantaloons</line>
        <line>of a dozen successive epochs, and greatly defaced at the knees by the</line>
        <line>humiliations of the wearer before his lady-love,--in short, we were a</line>
        <line>living epitome of defunct fashions, and the very raggedest presentment</line>
        <line>of men who had seen better days. It was gentility in tatters. Often</line>
        <line>retaining a scholarlike or clerical air, you might have taken us for</line>
        <line>the denizens of Grub Street, intent on getting a comfortable livelihood</line>
        <line>by agricultural labor; or Coleridge's projected Pantisocracy in full</line>
        <line>experiment; or Candide and his motley associates at work in their</line>
        <line>cabbage garden; or anything else that was miserably out at elbows, and</line>
        <line>most clumsily patched in the rear. We might have been sworn comrades</line>
        <line>to Falstaff's ragged regiment. Little skill as we boasted in other</line>
        <line>points of husbandry, every mother's son of us would have served</line>
        <line>admirably to stick up for a scarecrow. And the worst of the matter</line>
        <line>was, that the first energetic movement essential to one downright</line>
        <line>stroke of real labor was sure to put a finish to these poor</line>
        <line>habiliments. So we gradually flung them all aside, and took to honest</line>
        <line>homespun and linsey-woolsey, as preferable, on the whole, to the plan</line>
        <line>recommended, I think, by Virgil,--"Ara nudus; sere nudus, "--which as</line>
        <line>Silas Foster remarked, when I translated the maxim, would be apt to</line>
        <line>astonish the women-folks.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>After a reasonable training, the yeoman life throve well with us. Our</line>
        <line>faces took the sunburn kindly; our chests gained in compass, and our</line>
        <line>shoulders in breadth and squareness; our great brown fists looked as if</line>
        <line>they had never been capable of kid gloves. The plough, the hoe, the</line>
        <line>scythe, and the hay-fork grew familiar to our grasp. The oxen</line>
        <line>responded to our voices. We could do almost as fair a day's work as</line>
        <line>Silas Foster himself, sleep dreamlessly after it, and awake at daybreak</line>
        <line>with only a little stiffness of the joints, which was usually quite</line>
        <line>gone by breakfast-time.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>To be sure, our next neighbors pretended to be incredulous as to our</line>
        <line>real proficiency in the business which we had taken in hand. They told</line>
        <line>slanderous fables about our inability to yoke our own oxen, or to drive</line>
        <line>them afield when yoked, or to release the poor brutes from their</line>
        <line>conjugal bond at nightfall. They had the face to say, too, that the</line>
        <line>cows laughed at our awkwardness at milking-time, and invariably kicked</line>
        <line>over the pails; partly in consequence of our putting the stool on the</line>
        <line>wrong side, and partly because, taking offence at the whisking of their</line>
        <line>tails, we were in the habit of holding these natural fly-flappers with</line>
        <line>one hand and milking with the other. They further averred that we hoed</line>
        <line>up whole acres of Indian corn and other crops, and drew the earth</line>
        <line>carefully about the weeds; and that we raised five hundred tufts of</line>
        <line>burdock, mistaking them for cabbages; and that by dint of unskilful</line>
        <line>planting few of our seeds ever came up at all, or, if they did come up,</line>
        <line>it was stern-foremost; and that we spent the better part of the month</line>
        <line>of June in reversing a field of beans, which had thrust themselves out</line>
        <line>of the ground in this unseemly way. They quoted it as nothing more</line>
        <line>than an ordinary occurrence for one or other of us to crop off two or</line>
        <line>three fingers, of a morning, by our clumsy use of the hay-cutter.</line>
        <line>Finally, and as an ultimate catastrophe, these mendacious rogues</line>
        <line>circulated a report that we communitarians were exterminated, to the</line>
        <line>last man, by severing ourselves asunder with the sweep of our own</line>
        <line>scythes! and that the world had lost nothing by this little accident.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But this was pure envy and malice on the part of the neighboring</line>
        <line>farmers. The peril of our new way of life was not lest we should fail</line>
        <line>in becoming practical agriculturists, but that we should probably cease</line>
        <line>to be anything else. While our enterprise lay all in theory, we had</line>
        <line>pleased ourselves with delectable visions of the spiritualization of</line>
        <line>labor. It was to be our form of prayer and ceremonial of worship.</line>
        <line>Each stroke of the hoe was to uncover some aromatic root of wisdom,</line>
        <line>heretofore hidden from the sun. Pausing in the field, to let the wind</line>
        <line>exhale the moisture from our foreheads, we were to look upward, and</line>
        <line>catch glimpses into the far-off soul of truth. In this point of view,</line>
        <line>matters did not turn out quite so well as we anticipated. It is very</line>
        <line>true that, sometimes, gazing casually around me, out of the midst of my</line>
        <line>toil, I used to discern a richer picturesqueness in the visible scene</line>
        <line>of earth and sky. There was, at such moments, a novelty, an unwonted</line>
        <line>aspect, on the face of Nature, as if she had been taken by surprise and</line>
        <line>seen at unawares, with no opportunity to put off her real look, and</line>
        <line>assume the mask with which she mysteriously hides herself from mortals.</line>
        <line>But this was all. The clods of earth, which we so constantly belabored</line>
        <line>and turned over and over, were never etherealized into thought. Our</line>
        <line>thoughts, on the contrary, were fast becoming cloddish. Our labor</line>
        <line>symbolized nothing, and left us mentally sluggish in the dusk of the</line>
        <line>evening. Intellectual activity is incompatible with any large amount of</line>
        <line>bodily exercise. The yeoman and the scholar--the yeoman and the man of</line>
        <line>finest moral culture, though not the man of sturdiest sense and</line>
        <line>integrity--are two distinct individuals, and can never be melted or</line>
        <line>welded into one substance.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia soon saw this truth, and gibed me about it, one evening, as</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth and I lay on the grass, after a hard day's work.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I am afraid you did not make a song today, while loading the</line>
        <line>hay-cart," said she, "as Burns did, when he was reaping barley."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Burns never made a song in haying-time," I answered very positively.</line>
        <line>"He was no poet while a farmer, and no farmer while a poet."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And on the whole, which of the two characters do you like best?" asked</line>
        <line>Zenobia. "For I have an idea that you cannot combine them any better</line>
        <line>than Burns did. Ah, I see, in my mind's eye, what sort of an</line>
        <line>individual you are to be, two or three years hence. Grim Silas Foster</line>
        <line>is your prototype, with his palm of sole-leather, and his joints of</line>
        <line>rusty iron (which all through summer keep the stiffness of what he</line>
        <line>calls his winter's rheumatize), and his brain of--I don't know what his</line>
        <line>brain is made of, unless it be a Savoy cabbage; but yours may be</line>
        <line>cauliflower, as a rather more delicate variety. Your physical man will</line>
        <line>be transmuted into salt beef and fried pork, at the rate, I should</line>
        <line>imagine, of a pound and a half a day; that being about the average</line>
        <line>which we find necessary in the kitchen. You will make your toilet for</line>
        <line>the day (still like this delightful Silas Foster) by rinsing your</line>
        <line>fingers and the front part of your face in a little tin pan of water at</line>
        <line>the doorstep, and teasing your hair with a wooden pocket-comb before a</line>
        <line>seven-by-nine-inch looking-glass. Your only pastime will be to smoke</line>
        <line>some very vile tobacco in the black stump of a pipe."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Pray, spare me!" cried "But the pipe is not Silas's only mode of</line>
        <line>solacing himself with the weed."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Your literature," continued Zenobia, apparently delighted with her</line>
        <line>description, "will be the 'Farmer's Almanac;' for I observe our friend</line>
        <line>Foster never gets so far as the newspaper. When you happen to sit</line>
        <line>down, at odd moments, you will fall asleep, and make nasal proclamation</line>
        <line>of the fact, as he does; and invariably you must be jogged out of a</line>
        <line>nap, after supper, by the future Mrs. Coverdale, and persuaded to go</line>
        <line>regularly to bed. And on Sundays, when you put on a blue coat with</line>
        <line>brass buttons, you will think of nothing else to do but to go and</line>
        <line>lounge over the stone walls and rail fences, and stare at the corn</line>
        <line>growing. And you will look with a knowing eye at oxen, and will have a</line>
        <line>tendency to clamber over into pigsties, and feel of the hogs, and give</line>
        <line>a guess how much they will weigh after you shall have stuck and dressed</line>
        <line>them. Already I have noticed you begin to speak through your nose, and</line>
        <line>with a drawl. Pray, if you really did make any poetry to-day, let us</line>
        <line>hear it in that kind of utterance!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Coverdale has given up making verses now," said Hollingsworth, who</line>
        <line>never had the slightest appreciation of my poetry. "Just think of him</line>
        <line>penning a sonnet with a fist like that! There is at least this good in</line>
        <line>a life of toil, that it takes the nonsense and fancy-work out of a man,</line>
        <line>and leaves nothing but what truly belongs to him. If a farmer can make</line>
        <line>poetry at the plough-tail, it must be because his nature insists on it;</line>
        <line>and if that be the case, let him make it, in Heaven's name!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And how is it with you?" asked Zenobia, in a different voice; for she</line>
        <line>never laughed at Hollingsworth, as she often did at me. "You, I think,</line>
        <line>cannot have ceased to live a life of thought and feeling."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I have always been in earnest," answered Hollingsworth. "I have</line>
        <line>hammered thought out of iron, after heating the iron in my heart! It</line>
        <line>matters little what my outward toil may be. Were I a slave, at the</line>
        <line>bottom of a mine, I should keep the same purpose, the same faith in its</line>
        <line>ultimate accomplishment, that I do now. Miles Coverdale is not in</line>
        <line>earnest, either as a poet or a laborer."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You give me hard measure, Hollingsworth," said I, a little hurt. "I</line>
        <line>have kept pace with you in the field; and my bones feel as if I had</line>
        <line>been in earnest, whatever may be the case with my brain!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I cannot conceive," observed Zenobia with great emphasis,--and, no</line>
        <line>doubt, she spoke fairly the feeling of the moment,--"I cannot conceive</line>
        <line>of being so continually as Mr. Coverdale is within the sphere of a</line>
        <line>strong and noble nature, without being strengthened and ennobled by its</line>
        <line>influence!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>This amiable remark of the fair Zenobia confirmed me in what I had</line>
        <line>already begun to suspect, that Hollingsworth, like many other</line>
        <line>illustrious prophets, reformers, and philanthropists, was likely to</line>
        <line>make at least two proselytes among the women to one among the men.</line>
        <line>Zenobia and Priscilla! These, I believe (unless my unworthy self might</line>
        <line>be reckoned for a third), were the only disciples of his mission; and I</line>
        <line>spent a great deal of time, uselessly, in trying to conjecture what</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth meant to do with them--and they with him!</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>HOLLINGSWORTH, ZENOBIA, PRISCILLA</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It is not, I apprehend, a healthy kind of mental occupation to devote</line>
        <line>ourselves too exclusively to the study of individual men and women. If</line>
        <line>the person under examination be one's self, the result is pretty</line>
        <line>certain to be diseased action of the heart, almost before we can snatch</line>
        <line>a second glance. Or if we take the freedom to put a friend under our</line>
        <line>microscope, we thereby insulate him from many of his true relations,</line>
        <line>magnify his peculiarities, inevitably tear him into parts, and of</line>
        <line>course patch him very clumsily together again. What wonder, then,</line>
        <line>should we be frightened by the aspect of a monster, which, after</line>
        <line>all,--though we can point to every feature of his deformity in the real</line>
        <line>personage,--may be said to have been created mainly by ourselves.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Thus, as my conscience has often whispered me, I did Hollingsworth a</line>
        <line>great wrong by prying into his character; and am perhaps doing him as</line>
        <line>great a one, at this moment, by putting faith in the discoveries which</line>
        <line>I seemed to make. But I could not help it. Had I loved him less, I</line>
        <line>might have used him better. He and Zenobia and Priscilla--both for</line>
        <line>their own sakes and as connected with him--were separated from the rest</line>
        <line>of the Community, to my imagination, and stood forth as the indices of</line>
        <line>a problem which it was my business to solve. Other associates had a</line>
        <line>portion of my time; other matters amused me; passing occurrences</line>
        <line>carried me along with them, while they lasted. But here was the vortex</line>
        <line>of my meditations, around which they revolved, and whitherward they too</line>
        <line>continually tended. In the midst of cheerful society, I had often a</line>
        <line>feeling of loneliness. For it was impossible not to be sensible that,</line>
        <line>while these three characters figured so largely on my private theatre,</line>
        <line>I--though probably reckoned as a friend by all--was at best but a</line>
        <line>secondary or tertiary personage with either of them.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I loved Hollingsworth, as has already been enough expressed. But it</line>
        <line>impressed me, more and more, that there was a stern and dreadful</line>
        <line>peculiarity in this man, such as could not prove otherwise than</line>
        <line>pernicious to the happiness of those who should be drawn into too</line>
        <line>intimate a connection with him. He was not altogether human. There</line>
        <line>was something else in Hollingsworth besides flesh and blood, and</line>
        <line>sympathies and affections and celestial spirit.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>This is always true of those men who have surrendered themselves to an</line>
        <line>overruling purpose. It does not so much impel them from without, nor</line>
        <line>even operate as a motive power within, but grows incorporate with all</line>
        <line>that they think and feel, and finally converts them into little else</line>
        <line>save that one principle. When such begins to be the predicament, it is</line>
        <line>not cowardice, but wisdom, to avoid these victims. They have no heart,</line>
        <line>no sympathy, no reason, no conscience. They will keep no friend,</line>
        <line>unless he make himself the mirror of their purpose; they will smite and</line>
        <line>slay you, and trample your dead corpse under foot, all the more</line>
        <line>readily, if you take the first step with them, and cannot take the</line>
        <line>second, and the third, and every other step of their terribly strait</line>
        <line>path. They have an idol to which they consecrate themselves</line>
        <line>high-priest, and deem it holy work to offer sacrifices of whatever is</line>
        <line>most precious; and never once seem to suspect--so cunning has the Devil</line>
        <line>been with them--that this false deity, in whose iron features,</line>
        <line>immitigable to all the rest of mankind, they see only benignity and</line>
        <line>love, is but a spectrum of the very priest himself, projected upon the</line>
        <line>surrounding darkness. And the higher and purer the original object,</line>
        <line>and the more unselfishly it may have been taken up, the slighter is the</line>
        <line>probability that they can be led to recognize the process by which</line>
        <line>godlike benevolence has been debased into all-devouring egotism.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Of course I am perfectly aware that the above statement is exaggerated,</line>
        <line>in the attempt to make it adequate. Professed philanthropists have</line>
        <line>gone far; but no originally good man, I presume, ever went quite so far</line>
        <line>as this. Let the reader abate whatever he deems fit. The paragraph</line>
        <line>may remain, however, both for its truth and its exaggeration, as</line>
        <line>strongly expressive of the tendencies which were really operative in</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, and as exemplifying the kind of error into which my mode</line>
        <line>of observation was calculated to lead me. The issue was, that in</line>
        <line>solitude I often shuddered at my friend. In my recollection of his</line>
        <line>dark and impressive countenance, the features grew more sternly</line>
        <line>prominent than the reality, duskier in their depth and shadow, and more</line>
        <line>lurid in their light; the frown, that had merely flitted across his</line>
        <line>brow, seemed to have contorted it with an adamantine wrinkle. On</line>
        <line>meeting him again, I was often filled with remorse, when his deep eyes</line>
        <line>beamed kindly upon me, as with the glow of a household fire that was</line>
        <line>burning in a cave. "He is a man after all," thought I; "his Maker's</line>
        <line>own truest image, a philanthropic man!--not that steel engine of the</line>
        <line>Devil's contrivance, a philanthropist!" But in my wood-walks, and in my</line>
        <line>silent chamber, the dark face frowned at me again.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>When a young girl comes within the sphere of such a man, she is as</line>
        <line>perilously situated as the maiden whom, in the old classical myths, the</line>
        <line>people used to expose to a dragon. If I had any duty whatever, in</line>
        <line>reference to Hollingsworth, it was to endeavor to save Priscilla from</line>
        <line>that kind of personal worship which her sex is generally prone to</line>
        <line>lavish upon saints and heroes. It often requires but one smile out of</line>
        <line>the hero's eyes into the girl's or woman's heart, to transform this</line>
        <line>devotion, from a sentiment of the highest approval and confidence, into</line>
        <line>passionate love. Now, Hollingsworth smiled much upon Priscilla,--more</line>
        <line>than upon any other person. If she thought him beautiful, it was no</line>
        <line>wonder. I often thought him so, with the expression of tender human</line>
        <line>care and gentlest sympathy which she alone seemed to have power to call</line>
        <line>out upon his features. Zenobia, I suspect, would have given her eyes,</line>
        <line>bright as they were, for such a look; it was the least that our poor</line>
        <line>Priscilla could do, to give her heart for a great many of them. There</line>
        <line>was the more danger of this, inasmuch as the footing on which we all</line>
        <line>associated at Blithedale was widely different from that of conventional</line>
        <line>society. While inclining us to the soft affections of the golden age,</line>
        <line>it seemed to authorize any individual, of either sex, to fall in love</line>
        <line>with any other, regardless of what would elsewhere be judged suitable</line>
        <line>and prudent. Accordingly the tender passion was very rife among us, in</line>
        <line>various degrees of mildness or virulence, but mostly passing away with</line>
        <line>the state of things that had given it origin. This was all well</line>
        <line>enough; but, for a girl like Priscilla and a woman like Zenobia to</line>
        <line>jostle one another in their love of a man like Hollingsworth, was</line>
        <line>likely to be no child's play.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Had I been as cold-hearted as I sometimes thought myself, nothing would</line>
        <line>have interested me more than to witness the play of passions that must</line>
        <line>thus have been evolved. But, in honest truth, I would really have gone</line>
        <line>far to save Priscilla, at least, from the catastrophe in which such a</line>
        <line>drama would be apt to terminate.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Priscilla had now grown to be a very pretty girl, and still kept</line>
        <line>budding and blossoming, and daily putting on some new charm, which you</line>
        <line>no sooner became sensible of than you thought it worth all that she had</line>
        <line>previously possessed. So unformed, vague, and without substance, as</line>
        <line>she had come to us, it seemed as if we could see Nature shaping out a</line>
        <line>woman before our very eyes, and yet had only a more reverential sense</line>
        <line>of the mystery of a woman's soul and frame. Yesterday, her cheek was</line>
        <line>pale, to-day, it had a bloom. Priscilla's smile, like a baby's first</line>
        <line>one, was a wondrous novelty. Her imperfections and shortcomings</line>
        <line>affected me with a kind of playful pathos, which was as absolutely</line>
        <line>bewitching a sensation as ever I experienced. After she had been a</line>
        <line>month or two at Blithedale, her animal spirits waxed high, and kept her</line>
        <line>pretty constantly in a state of bubble and ferment, impelling her to</line>
        <line>far more bodily activity than she had yet strength to endure. She was</line>
        <line>very fond of playing with the other girls out of doors. There is</line>
        <line>hardly another sight in the world so pretty as that of a company of</line>
        <line>young girls, almost women grown, at play, and so giving themselves up</line>
        <line>to their airy impulse that their tiptoes barely touch the ground.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Girls are incomparably wilder and more effervescent than boys, more</line>
        <line>untamable and regardless of rule and limit, with an ever-shifting</line>
        <line>variety, breaking continually into new modes of fun, yet with a</line>
        <line>harmonious propriety through all. Their steps, their voices, appear</line>
        <line>free as the wind, but keep consonance with a strain of music inaudible</line>
        <line>to us. Young men and boys, on the other hand, play, according to</line>
        <line>recognized law, old, traditionary games, permitting no caprioles of</line>
        <line>fancy, but with scope enough for the outbreak of savage instincts.</line>
        <line>For, young or old, in play or in earnest, man is prone to be a brute.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Especially is it delightful to see a vigorous young girl run a race,</line>
        <line>with her head thrown back, her limbs moving more friskily than they</line>
        <line>need, and an air between that of a bird and a young colt. But</line>
        <line>Priscilla's peculiar charm, in a foot-race, was the weakness and</line>
        <line>irregularity with which she ran. Growing up without exercise, except</line>
        <line>to her poor little fingers, she had never yet acquired the perfect use</line>
        <line>of her legs. Setting buoyantly forth, therefore, as if no rival less</line>
        <line>swift than Atalanta could compete with her, she ran falteringly, and</line>
        <line>often tumbled on the grass. Such an incident--though it seems too</line>
        <line>slight to think of--was a thing to laugh at, but which brought the</line>
        <line>water into one's eyes, and lingered in the memory after far greater</line>
        <line>joys and sorrows were wept out of it, as antiquated trash. Priscilla's</line>
        <line>life, as I beheld it, was full of trifles that affected me in just this</line>
        <line>way.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>When she had come to be quite at home among us, I used to fancy that</line>
        <line>Priscilla played more pranks, and perpetrated more mischief, than any</line>
        <line>other girl in the Community. For example, I once heard Silas Foster,</line>
        <line>in a very gruff voice, threatening to rivet three horseshoes round</line>
        <line>Priscilla's neck and chain her to a post, because she, with some other</line>
        <line>young people, had clambered upon a load of hay, and caused it to slide</line>
        <line>off the cart. How she made her peace I never knew; but very soon</line>
        <line>afterwards I saw old Silas, with his brawny hands round Priscilla's</line>
        <line>waist, swinging her to and fro, and finally depositing her on one of</line>
        <line>the oxen, to take her first lessons in riding. She met with terrible</line>
        <line>mishaps in her efforts to milk a cow; she let the poultry into the</line>
        <line>garden; she generally spoilt whatever part of the dinner she took in</line>
        <line>charge; she broke crockery; she dropt our biggest water pitcher into</line>
        <line>the well; and--except with her needle, and those little wooden</line>
        <line>instruments for purse-making--was as unserviceable a member of society</line>
        <line>as any young lady in the land. There was no other sort of efficiency</line>
        <line>about her. Yet everybody was kind to Priscilla; everybody loved her</line>
        <line>and laughed at her to her face, and did not laugh behind her back;</line>
        <line>everybody would have given her half of his last crust, or the bigger</line>
        <line>share of his plum-cake. These were pretty certain indications that we</line>
        <line>were all conscious of a pleasant weakness in the girl, and considered</line>
        <line>her not quite able to look after her own interests or fight her battle</line>
        <line>with the world. And Hollingsworth--perhaps because he had been the</line>
        <line>means of introducing Priscilla to her new abode--appeared to recognize</line>
        <line>her as his own especial charge.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Her simple, careless, childish flow of spirits often made me sad. She</line>
        <line>seemed to me like a butterfly at play in a flickering bit of sunshine,</line>
        <line>and mistaking it for a broad and eternal summer. We sometimes hold</line>
        <line>mirth to a stricter accountability than sorrow; it must show good</line>
        <line>cause, or the echo of its laughter comes back drearily. Priscilla's</line>
        <line>gayety, moreover, was of a nature that showed me how delicate an</line>
        <line>instrument she was, and what fragile harp-strings were her nerves. As</line>
        <line>they made sweet music at the airiest touch, it would require but a</line>
        <line>stronger one to burst them all asunder. Absurd as it might be, I tried</line>
        <line>to reason with her, and persuade her not to be so joyous, thinking</line>
        <line>that, if she would draw less lavishly upon her fund of happiness, it</line>
        <line>would last the longer. I remember doing so, one summer evening, when</line>
        <line>we tired laborers sat looking on, like Goldsmith's old folks under the</line>
        <line>village thorn-tree, while the young people were at their sports.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What is the use or sense of being so very gay?" I said to Priscilla,</line>
        <line>while she was taking breath, after a great frolic. "I love to see a</line>
        <line>sufficient cause for everything, and I can see none for this. Pray</line>
        <line>tell me, now, what kind of a world you imagine this to be, which you</line>
        <line>are so merry in."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I never think about it at all," answered Priscilla, laughing. "But</line>
        <line>this I am sure of, that it is a world where everybody is kind to me,</line>
        <line>and where I love everybody. My heart keeps dancing within me, and all</line>
        <line>the foolish things which you see me do are only the motions of my</line>
        <line>heart. How can I be dismal, if my heart will not let me?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Have you nothing dismal to remember?" I suggested. "If not, then,</line>
        <line>indeed, you are very fortunate!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah!" said Priscilla slowly.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And then came that unintelligible gesture, when she seemed to be</line>
        <line>listening to a distant voice.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"For my part," I continued, beneficently seeking to overshadow her with</line>
        <line>my own sombre humor, "my past life has been a tiresome one enough; yet</line>
        <line>I would rather look backward ten times than forward once. For, little</line>
        <line>as we know of our life to come, we may be very sure, for one thing,</line>
        <line>that the good we aim at will not be attained. People never do get just</line>
        <line>the good they seek. If it come at all, it is something else, which</line>
        <line>they never dreamed of, and did not particularly want. Then, again, we</line>
        <line>may rest certain that our friends of to-day will not be our friends of</line>
        <line>a few years hence; but, if we keep one of them, it will be at the</line>
        <line>expense of the others; and most probably we shall keep none. To be</line>
        <line>sure, there are more to be had; but who cares about making a new set of</line>
        <line>friends, even should they be better than those around us?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Not I!" said Priscilla. "I will live and die with these!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well; but let the future go," resumed "As for the present moment,</line>
        <line>if we could look into the hearts where we wish to be most valued, what</line>
        <line>should you expect to see? One's own likeness, in the innermost,</line>
        <line>holiest niche? Ah! I don't know! It may not be there at all. It may</line>
        <line>be a dusty image, thrust aside into a corner, and by and by to be flung</line>
        <line>out of doors, where any foot may trample upon it. If not to-day, then</line>
        <line>to-morrow! And so, Priscilla, I do not see much wisdom in being so</line>
        <line>very merry in this kind of a world."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It had taken me nearly seven years of worldly life to hive up the</line>
        <line>bitter honey which I here offered to Priscilla. And she rejected it!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I don't believe one word of what you say!" she replied, laughing anew.</line>
        <line>"You made me sad, for a minute, by talking about the past; but the past</line>
        <line>never comes back again. Do we dream the same dream twice? There is</line>
        <line>nothing else that I am afraid of."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>So away she ran, and fell down on the green grass, as it was often her</line>
        <line>luck to do, but got up again, without any harm.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Priscilla, Priscilla!" cried Hollingsworth, who was sitting on the</line>
        <line>doorstep; "you had better not run any more to-night. You will weary</line>
        <line>yourself too much. And do not sit down out of doors, for there is a</line>
        <line>heavy dew beginning to fall."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>At his first word, she went and sat down under the porch, at</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's feet, entirely contented and happy. What charm was</line>
        <line>there in his rude massiveness that so attracted and soothed this</line>
        <line>shadow-like girl? It appeared to me, who have always been curious in</line>
        <line>such matters, that Priscilla's vague and seemingly causeless flow of</line>
        <line>felicitous feeling was that with which love blesses inexperienced</line>
        <line>hearts, before they begin to suspect what is going on within them. It</line>
        <line>transports them to the seventh heaven; and if you ask what brought them</line>
        <line>thither, they neither can tell nor care to learn, but cherish an</line>
        <line>ecstatic faith that there they shall abide forever.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia was in the doorway, not far from Hollingsworth. She gazed at</line>
        <line>Priscilla in a very singular way. Indeed, it was a sight worth gazing</line>
        <line>at, and a beautiful sight, too, as the fair girl sat at the feet of</line>
        <line>that dark, powerful figure. Her air, while perfectly modest, delicate,</line>
        <line>and virgin-like, denoted her as swayed by Hollingsworth, attracted to</line>
        <line>him, and unconsciously seeking to rest upon his strength. I could not</line>
        <line>turn away my own eyes, but hoped that nobody, save Zenobia and myself,</line>
        <line>was witnessing this picture. It is before me now, with the evening</line>
        <line>twilight a little deepened by the dusk of memory.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Come hither, Priscilla," said Zenobia. "I have something to say to</line>
        <line>you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She spoke in little more than a whisper. But it is strange how</line>
        <line>expressive of moods a whisper may often be. Priscilla felt at once</line>
        <line>that something had gone wrong.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Are you angry with me?" she asked, rising slowly, and standing before</line>
        <line>Zenobia in a drooping attitude. "What have I done? I hope you are not</line>
        <line>angry!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No, no, Priscilla!" said Hollingsworth, smiling. "I will answer for</line>
        <line>it, she is not. You are the one little person in the world with whom</line>
        <line>nobody can be angry!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Angry with you, child? What a silly idea!" exclaimed Zenobia,</line>
        <line>laughing. "No, indeed! But, my dear Priscilla, you are getting to be</line>
        <line>so very pretty that you absolutely need a duenna; and, as I am older</line>
        <line>than you, and have had my own little experience of life, and think</line>
        <line>myself exceedingly sage, I intend to fill the place of a maiden aunt.</line>
        <line>Every day, I shall give you a lecture, a quarter of an hour in length,</line>
        <line>on the morals, manners, and proprieties of social life. When our</line>
        <line>pastoral shall be quite played out, Priscilla, my worldly wisdom may</line>
        <line>stand you in good stead."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I am afraid you are angry with me!" repeated Priscilla sadly; for,</line>
        <line>while she seemed as impressible as wax, the girl often showed a</line>
        <line>persistency in her own ideas as stubborn as it was gentle.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Dear me, what can I say to the child!" cried Zenobia in a tone of</line>
        <line>humorous vexation. "Well, well; since you insist on my being angry,</line>
        <line>come to my room this moment, and let me beat you!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia bade Hollingsworth good-night very sweetly, and nodded to me</line>
        <line>with a smile. But, just as she turned aside with Priscilla into the</line>
        <line>dimness of the porch, I caught another glance at her countenance. It</line>
        <line>would have made the fortune of a tragic actress, could she have</line>
        <line>borrowed it for the moment when she fumbles in her bosom for the</line>
        <line>concealed dagger, or the exceedingly sharp bodkin, or mingles the</line>
        <line>ratsbane in her lover's bowl of wine or her rival's cup of tea. Not</line>
        <line>that I in the least anticipated any such catastrophe,--it being a</line>
        <line>remarkable truth that custom has in no one point a greater sway than</line>
        <line>over our modes of wreaking our wild passions. And besides, had we been</line>
        <line>in Italy, instead of New England, it was hardly yet a crisis for the</line>
        <line>dagger or the bowl.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It often amazed me, however, that Hollingsworth should show himself so</line>
        <line>recklessly tender towards Priscilla, and never once seem to think of</line>
        <line>the effect which it might have upon her heart. But the man, as I have</line>
        <line>endeavored to explain, was thrown completely off his moral balance, and</line>
        <line>quite bewildered as to his personal relations, by his great excrescence</line>
        <line>of a philanthropic scheme. I used to see, or fancy, indications that</line>
        <line>he was not altogether obtuse to Zenobia's influence as a woman. No</line>
        <line>doubt, however, he had a still more exquisite enjoyment of Priscilla's</line>
        <line>silent sympathy with his purposes, so unalloyed with criticism, and</line>
        <line>therefore more grateful than any intellectual approbation, which always</line>
        <line>involves a possible reserve of latent censure. A man--poet, prophet,</line>
        <line>or whatever he may be--readily persuades himself of his right to all</line>
        <line>the worship that is voluntarily tendered. In requital of so rich</line>
        <line>benefits as he was to confer upon mankind, it would have been hard to</line>
        <line>deny Hollingsworth the simple solace of a young girl's heart, which he</line>
        <line>held in his hand, and smelled too, like a rosebud. But what if, while</line>
        <line>pressing out its fragrance, he should crush the tender rosebud in his</line>
        <line>grasp!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As for Zenobia, I saw no occasion to give myself any trouble. With her</line>
        <line>native strength, and her experience of the world, she could not be</line>
        <line>supposed to need any help of mine. Nevertheless, I was really generous</line>
        <line>enough to feel some little interest likewise for Zenobia. With all her</line>
        <line>faults (which might have been a great many besides the abundance that I</line>
        <line>knew of), she possessed noble traits, and a heart which must, at least,</line>
        <line>have been valuable while new. And she seemed ready to fling it away as</line>
        <line>uncalculatingly as Priscilla herself. I could not but suspect that, if</line>
        <line>merely at play with Hollingsworth, she was sporting with a power which</line>
        <line>she did not fully estimate. Or if in earnest, it might chance, between</line>
        <line>Zenobia's passionate force and his dark, self-delusive egotism, to turn</line>
        <line>out such earnest as would develop itself in some sufficiently tragic</line>
        <line>catastrophe, though the dagger and the bowl should go for nothing in it.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Meantime, the gossip of the Community set them down as a pair of</line>
        <line>lovers. They took walks together, and were not seldom encountered in</line>
        <line>the wood-paths: Hollingsworth deeply discoursing, in tones solemn and</line>
        <line>sternly pathetic; Zenobia, with a rich glow on her cheeks, and her eyes</line>
        <line>softened from their ordinary brightness, looked so beautiful, that had</line>
        <line>her companion been ten times a philanthropist, it seemed impossible but</line>
        <line>that one glance should melt him back into a man. Oftener than anywhere</line>
        <line>else, they went to a certain point on the slope of a pasture,</line>
        <line>commanding nearly the whole of our own domain, besides a view of the</line>
        <line>river, and an airy prospect of many distant hills. The bond of our</line>
        <line>Community was such, that the members had the privilege of building</line>
        <line>cottages for their own residence within our precincts, thus laying a</line>
        <line>hearthstone and fencing in a home private and peculiar to all desirable</line>
        <line>extent, while yet the inhabitants should continue to share the</line>
        <line>advantages of an associated life. It was inferred that Hollingsworth</line>
        <line>and Zenobia intended to rear their dwelling on this favorite spot.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I mentioned those rumors to Hollingsworth in a playful way.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Had you consulted me," I went on to observe, "I should have</line>
        <line>recommended a site farther to the left, just a little withdrawn into</line>
        <line>the wood, with two or three peeps at the prospect among the trees. You</line>
        <line>will be in the shady vale of years long before you can raise any better</line>
        <line>kind of shade around your cottage, if you build it on this bare slope."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"But I offer my edifice as a spectacle to the world," said</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, "that it may take example and build many another like</line>
        <line>it. Therefore, I mean to set it on the open hillside."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Twist these words how I might, they offered no very satisfactory</line>
        <line>import. It seemed hardly probable that Hollingsworth should care about</line>
        <line>educating the public taste in the department of cottage architecture,</line>
        <line>desirable as such improvement certainly was.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>A VISITOR FROM TOWN</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hollingsworth and I--we had been hoeing potatoes, that forenoon, while</line>
        <line>the rest of the fraternity were engaged in a distant quarter of the</line>
        <line>farm--sat under a clump of maples, eating our eleven o'clock lunch,</line>
        <line>when we saw a stranger approaching along the edge of the field. He had</line>
        <line>admitted himself from the roadside through a turnstile, and seemed to</line>
        <line>have a purpose of speaking with us.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And, by the bye, we were favored with many visits at Blithedale,</line>
        <line>especially from people who sympathized with our theories, and perhaps</line>
        <line>held themselves ready to unite in our actual experiment as soon as</line>
        <line>there should appear a reliable promise of its success. It was rather</line>
        <line>ludicrous, indeed (to me, at least, whose enthusiasm had insensibly</line>
        <line>been exhaled together with the perspiration of many a hard day's toil),</line>
        <line>it was absolutely funny, therefore, to observe what a glory was shed</line>
        <line>about our life and labors, in the imaginations of these longing</line>
        <line>proselytes. In their view, we were as poetical as Arcadians, besides</line>
        <line>being as practical as the hardest-fisted husbandmen in Massachusetts.</line>
        <line>We did not, it is true, spend much time in piping to our sheep, or</line>
        <line>warbling our innocent loves to the sisterhood. But they gave us credit</line>
        <line>for imbuing the ordinary rustic occupations with a kind of religious</line>
        <line>poetry, insomuch that our very cow-yards and pig-sties were as</line>
        <line>delightfully fragrant as a flower garden. Nothing used to please me</line>
        <line>more than to see one of these lay enthusiasts snatch up a hoe, as they</line>
        <line>were very prone to do, and set to work with a vigor that perhaps</line>
        <line>carried him through about a dozen ill-directed strokes. Men are</line>
        <line>wonderfully soon satisfied, in this day of shameful bodily enervation,</line>
        <line>when, from one end of life to the other, such multitudes never taste</line>
        <line>the sweet weariness that follows accustomed toil. I seldom saw the new</line>
        <line>enthusiasm that did not grow as flimsy and flaccid as the proselyte's</line>
        <line>moistened shirt-collar, with a quarter of an hour's active labor under</line>
        <line>a July sun.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But the person now at hand had not at all the air of one of these</line>
        <line>amiable visionaries. He was an elderly man, dressed rather shabbily,</line>
        <line>yet decently enough, in a gray frock-coat, faded towards a brown hue,</line>
        <line>and wore a broad-brimmed white hat, of the fashion of several years</line>
        <line>gone by. His hair was perfect silver, without a dark thread in the</line>
        <line>whole of it; his nose, though it had a scarlet tip, by no means</line>
        <line>indicated the jollity of which a red nose is the generally admitted</line>
        <line>symbol. He was a subdued, undemonstrative old man, who would doubtless</line>
        <line>drink a glass of liquor, now and then, and probably more than was good</line>
        <line>for him,--not, however, with a purpose of undue exhilaration, but in</line>
        <line>the hope of bringing his spirits up to the ordinary level of the</line>
        <line>world's cheerfulness. Drawing nearer, there was a shy look about him,</line>
        <line>as if he were ashamed of his poverty, or, at any rate, for some reason</line>
        <line>or other, would rather have us glance at him sidelong than take a full</line>
        <line>front view. He had a queer appearance of hiding himself behind the</line>
        <line>patch on his left eye.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I know this old gentleman," said I to Hollingsworth, as we sat</line>
        <line>observing him; "that is, I have met him a hundred times in town, and</line>
        <line>have often amused my fancy with wondering what he was before he came to</line>
        <line>be what he is. He haunts restaurants and such places, and has an odd</line>
        <line>way of lurking in corners or getting behind a door whenever</line>
        <line>practicable, and holding out his hand with some little article in it</line>
        <line>which he wishes you to buy. The eye of the world seems to trouble him,</line>
        <line>although he necessarily lives so much in it. I never expected to see</line>
        <line>him in an open field."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Have you learned anything of his history?" asked Hollingsworth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Not a circumstance," I answered; "but there must be something curious</line>
        <line>in it. I take him to be a harmless sort of a person, and a tolerably</line>
        <line>honest one; but his manners, being so furtive, remind me of those of a</line>
        <line>rat,--a rat without the mischief, the fierce eye, the teeth to bite</line>
        <line>with, or the desire to bite. See, now! He means to skulk along that</line>
        <line>fringe of bushes, and approach us on the other side of our clump of</line>
        <line>maples."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>We soon heard the old man's velvet tread on the grass, indicating that</line>
        <line>he had arrived within a few feet of where we Sat.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Good-morning, Mr. Moodie," said Hollingsworth, addressing the stranger</line>
        <line>as an acquaintance; "you must have had a hot and tiresome walk from the</line>
        <line>city. Sit down, and take a morsel of our bread and cheese."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The visitor made a grateful little murmur of acquiescence, and sat down</line>
        <line>in a spot somewhat removed; so that, glancing round, I could see his</line>
        <line>gray pantaloons and dusty shoes, while his upper part was mostly hidden</line>
        <line>behind the shrubbery. Nor did he come forth from this retirement</line>
        <line>during the whole of the interview that followed. We handed him such</line>
        <line>food as we had, together with a brown jug of molasses and water (would</line>
        <line>that it had been brandy, or some thing better, for the sake of his</line>
        <line>chill old heart!), like priests offering dainty sacrifice to an</line>
        <line>enshrined and invisible idol. I have no idea that he really lacked</line>
        <line>sustenance; but it was quite touching, nevertheless, to hear him</line>
        <line>nibbling away at our crusts.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Mr. Moodie," said I, "do you remember selling me one of those very</line>
        <line>pretty little silk purses, of which you seem to have a monopoly in the</line>
        <line>market? I keep it to this day, I can assure you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, thank you," said our guest. "Yes, Mr. Coverdale, I used to sell a</line>
        <line>good many of those little purses."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>He spoke languidly, and only those few words, like a watch with an</line>
        <line>inelastic spring, that just ticks a moment or two and stops again. He</line>
        <line>seemed a very forlorn old man. In the wantonness of youth, strength,</line>
        <line>and comfortable condition,--making my prey of people's individualities,</line>
        <line>as my custom was,--I tried to identify my mind with the old fellow's,</line>
        <line>and take his view of the world, as if looking through a smoke-blackened</line>
        <line>glass at the sun. It robbed the landscape of all its life. Those</line>
        <line>pleasantly swelling slopes of our farm, descending towards the wide</line>
        <line>meadows, through which sluggishly circled the brimful tide of the</line>
        <line>Charles, bathing the long sedges on its hither and farther shores; the</line>
        <line>broad, sunny gleam over the winding water; that peculiar</line>
        <line>picturesqueness of the scene where capes and headlands put themselves</line>
        <line>boldly forth upon the perfect level of the meadow, as into a green</line>
        <line>lake, with inlets between the promontories; the shadowy woodland, with</line>
        <line>twinkling showers of light falling into its depths; the sultry</line>
        <line>heat-vapor, which rose everywhere like incense, and in which my soul</line>
        <line>delighted, as indicating so rich a fervor in the passionate day, and in</line>
        <line>the earth that was burning with its love,--I beheld all these things as</line>
        <line>through old Moodie's eyes. When my eyes are dimmer than they have yet</line>
        <line>come to be, I will go thither again, and see if I did not catch the</line>
        <line>tone of his mind aright, and if the cold and lifeless tint of his</line>
        <line>perceptions be not then repeated in my own.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Yet it was unaccountable to myself, the interest that I felt in him.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Have you any objection," said I, "to telling me who made those little</line>
        <line>purses?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Gentlemen have often asked me that," said Moodie slowly; "but I shake</line>
        <line>my head, and say little or nothing, and creep out of the way as well as</line>
        <line>I can. I am a man of few words; and if gentlemen were to be told one</line>
        <line>thing, they would be very apt, I suppose, to ask me another. But it</line>
        <line>happens just now, Mr. Coverdale, that you can tell me more about the</line>
        <line>maker of those little purses than I can tell you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Why do you trouble him with needless questions, Coverdale?"</line>
        <line>interrupted Hollingsworth. "You must have known, long ago, that it was</line>
        <line>Priscilla. And so, my good friend, you have come to see her? Well, I</line>
        <line>am glad of it. You will find her altered very much for the better,</line>
        <line>since that winter evening when you put her into my charge. Why,</line>
        <line>Priscilla has a bloom in her cheeks, now!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Has my pale little girl a bloom?" repeated Moodie with a kind of slow</line>
        <line>wonder. "Priscilla with a bloom in her cheeks! Ah, I am afraid I</line>
        <line>shall not know my little girl. And is she happy?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Just as happy as a bird," answered Hollingsworth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Then, gentlemen," said our guest apprehensively, "I don't think it</line>
        <line>well for me to go any farther. I crept hitherward only to ask about</line>
        <line>Priscilla; and now that you have told me such good news, perhaps I can</line>
        <line>do no better than to creep back again. If she were to see this old</line>
        <line>face of mine, the child would remember some very sad times which we</line>
        <line>have spent together. Some very sad times, indeed! She has forgotten</line>
        <line>them, I know,--them and me,--else she could not be so happy, nor have a</line>
        <line>bloom in her cheeks. Yes--yes--yes," continued he, still with the same</line>
        <line>torpid utterance; "with many thanks to you, Mr. Hollingsworth, I will</line>
        <line>creep back to town again."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You shall do no such thing, Mr. Moodie," said Hollingsworth bluffly.</line>
        <line>"Priscilla often speaks of you; and if there lacks anything to make her</line>
        <line>cheeks bloom like two damask roses, I'll venture to say it is just the</line>
        <line>sight of your face. Come,--we will go and find her."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Mr. Hollingsworth!" said the old man in his hesitating way.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well," answered Hollingsworth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Has there been any call for Priscilla?" asked Moodie; and though his</line>
        <line>face was hidden from us, his tone gave a sure indication of the</line>
        <line>mysterious nod and wink with which he put the question. "You know, I</line>
        <line>think, sir, what I mean."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I have not the remotest suspicion what you mean, Mr. Moodie," replied</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth; "nobody, to my knowledge, has called for Priscilla,</line>
        <line>except yourself. But come; we are losing time, and I have several</line>
        <line>things to say to you by the way."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And, Mr. Hollingsworth!" repeated Moodie.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, again!" cried my friend rather impatiently. "What now?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"There is a lady here," said the old man; and his voice lost some of</line>
        <line>its wearisome hesitation. "You will account it a very strange matter</line>
        <line>for me to talk about; but I chanced to know this lady when she was but</line>
        <line>a little child. If I am rightly informed, she has grown to be a very</line>
        <line>fine woman, and makes a brilliant figure in the world, with her beauty,</line>
        <line>and her talents, and her noble way of spending her riches. I should</line>
        <line>recognize this lady, so people tell me, by a magnificent flower in her</line>
        <line>hair."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What a rich tinge it gives to his colorless ideas, when he speaks of</line>
        <line>Zenobia!" I whispered to Hollingsworth. "But how can there possibly</line>
        <line>be any interest or connecting link between him and her?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"The old man, for years past," whispered Hollingsworth, "has been a</line>
        <line>little out of his right mind, as you probably see."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What I would inquire," resumed Moodie, "is whether this beautiful lady</line>
        <line>is kind to my poor Priscilla."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Very kind," said Hollingsworth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Does she love her?" asked Moodie.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It should seem so," answered my friend. "They are always together."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Like a gentlewoman and her maid-servant, I fancy?" suggested the old</line>
        <line>man.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There was something so singular in his way of saying this, that I could</line>
        <line>not resist the impulse to turn quite round, so as to catch a glimpse of</line>
        <line>his face, almost imagining that I should see another person than old</line>
        <line>Moodie. But there he sat, with the patched side of his face towards me.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Like an elder and younger sister, rather," replied Hollingsworth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah!" said Moodie more complacently, for his latter tones had harshness</line>
        <line>and acidity in them,--"it would gladden my old heart to witness that.</line>
        <line>If one thing would make me happier than another, Mr. Hollingsworth, it</line>
        <line>would be to see that beautiful lady holding my little girl by the hand."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Come along," said Hollingsworth, "and perhaps you may."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>After a little more delay on the part of our freakish visitor, they set</line>
        <line>forth together, old Moodie keeping a step or two behind Hollingsworth,</line>
        <line>so that the latter could not very conveniently look him in the face. I</line>
        <line>remained under the tuft of maples, doing my utmost to draw an inference</line>
        <line>from the scene that had just passed. In spite of Hollingsworth's</line>
        <line>off-hand explanation, it did not strike me that our strange guest was</line>
        <line>really beside himself, but only that his mind needed screwing up, like</line>
        <line>an instrument long out of tune, the strings of which have ceased to</line>
        <line>vibrate smartly and sharply. Methought it would be profitable for us,</line>
        <line>projectors of a happy life, to welcome this old gray shadow, and</line>
        <line>cherish him as one of us, and let him creep about our domain, in order</line>
        <line>that he might be a little merrier for our sakes, and we, sometimes, a</line>
        <line>little sadder for his. Human destinies look ominous without some</line>
        <line>perceptible intermixture of the sable or the gray. And then, too,</line>
        <line>should any of our fraternity grow feverish with an over-exulting sense</line>
        <line>of prosperity, it would be a sort of cooling regimen to slink off into</line>
        <line>the woods, and spend an hour, or a day, or as many days as might be</line>
        <line>requisite to the cure, in uninterrupted communion with this deplorable</line>
        <line>old Moodie!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Going homeward to dinner, I had a glimpse of him, behind the trunk of a</line>
        <line>tree, gazing earnestly towards a particular window of the farmhouse;</line>
        <line>and by and by Priscilla appeared at this window, playfully drawing</line>
        <line>along Zenobia, who looked as bright as the very day that was blazing</line>
        <line>down upon us, only not, by many degrees, so well advanced towards her</line>
        <line>noon. I was convinced that this pretty sight must have been purposely</line>
        <line>arranged by Priscilla for the old man to see. But either the girl held</line>
        <line>her too long, or her fondness was resented as too great a freedom; for</line>
        <line>Zenobia suddenly put Priscilla decidedly away, and gave her a haughty</line>
        <line>look, as from a mistress to a dependant. Old Moodie shook his head;</line>
        <line>and again and again I saw him shake it, as he withdrew along the road;</line>
        <line>and at the last point whence the farmhouse was visible, he turned and</line>
        <line>shook his uplifted staff.</line>

    <p>
        <title>THE WOOD-PATH</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Not long after the preceding incident, in order to get the ache of too</line>
        <line>constant labor out of my bones, and to relieve my spirit of the</line>
        <line>irksomeness of a settled routine, I took a holiday. It was my purpose</line>
        <line>to spend it all alone, from breakfast-time till twilight, in the</line>
        <line>deepest wood-seclusion that lay anywhere around us. Though fond of</line>
        <line>society, I was so constituted as to need these occasional retirements,</line>
        <line>even in a life like that of Blithedale, which was itself characterized</line>
        <line>by a remoteness from the world. Unless renewed by a yet further</line>
        <line>withdrawal towards the inner circle of self-communion, I lost the</line>
        <line>better part of my individuality. My thoughts became of little worth,</line>
        <line>and my sensibilities grew as arid as a tuft of moss (a thing whose life</line>
        <line>is in the shade, the rain, or the noontide dew), crumbling in the</line>
        <line>sunshine after long expectance of a shower. So, with my heart full of</line>
        <line>a drowsy pleasure, and cautious not to dissipate my mood by previous</line>
        <line>intercourse with any one, I hurried away, and was soon pacing a</line>
        <line>wood-path, arched overhead with boughs, and dusky-brown beneath my feet.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>At first I walked very swiftly, as if the heavy flood tide of social</line>
        <line>life were roaring at my heels, and would outstrip and overwhelm me,</line>
        <line>without all the better diligence in my escape. But, threading the more</line>
        <line>distant windings of the track, I abated my pace, and looked about me</line>
        <line>for some side-aisle, that should admit me into the innermost sanctuary</line>
        <line>of this green cathedral, just as, in human acquaintanceship, a casual</line>
        <line>opening sometimes lets us, all of a sudden, into the long-sought</line>
        <line>intimacy of a mysterious heart. So much was I absorbed in my</line>
        <line>reflections,--or, rather, in my mood, the substance of which was as yet</line>
        <line>too shapeless to be called thought,--that footsteps rustled on the</line>
        <line>leaves, and a figure passed me by, almost without impressing either the</line>
        <line>sound or sight upon my consciousness.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>A moment afterwards, I heard a voice at a little distance behind me,</line>
        <line>speaking so sharply and impertinently that it made a complete discord</line>
        <line>with my spiritual state, and caused the latter to vanish as abruptly as</line>
        <line>when you thrust a finger into a soap-bubble.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Halloo, friend!" cried this most unseasonable voice. "Stop a moment,</line>
        <line>I say! I must have a word with you!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I turned about, in a humor ludicrously irate. In the first place, the</line>
        <line>interruption, at any rate, was a grievous injury; then, the tone</line>
        <line>displeased me. And finally, unless there be real affection in his</line>
        <line>heart, a man cannot,--such is the bad state to which the world has</line>
        <line>brought itself,--cannot more effectually show his contempt for a</line>
        <line>brother mortal, nor more gallingly assume a position of superiority,</line>
        <line>than by addressing him as "friend." Especially does the misapplication</line>
        <line>of this phrase bring out that latent hostility which is sure to animate</line>
        <line>peculiar sects, and those who, with however generous a purpose, have</line>
        <line>sequestered themselves from the crowd; a feeling, it is true, which may</line>
        <line>be hidden in some dog-kennel of the heart, grumbling there in the</line>
        <line>darkness, but is never quite extinct, until the dissenting party have</line>
        <line>gained power and scope enough to treat the world generously. For my</line>
        <line>part, I should have taken it as far less an insult to be styled</line>
        <line>"fellow," "clown," or "bumpkin." To either of these appellations my</line>
        <line>rustic garb (it was a linen blouse, with checked shirt and striped</line>
        <line>pantaloons, a chip hat on my head, and a rough hickory stick in my</line>
        <line>hand) very fairly entitled me. As the case stood, my temper darted at</line>
        <line>once to the opposite pole; not friend, but enemy!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What do you want with me?" said I, facing about.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Come a little nearer, friend," said the stranger, beckoning.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No," answered "If I can do anything for you without too much</line>
        <line>trouble to myself, say so. But recollect, if you please, that you are</line>
        <line>not speaking to an acquaintance, much less a friend!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Upon my word, I believe not!" retorted he, looking at me with some</line>
        <line>curiosity; and, lifting his hat, he made me a salute which had enough</line>
        <line>of sarcasm to be offensive, and just enough of doubtful courtesy to</line>
        <line>render any resentment of it absurd. "But I ask your pardon! I</line>
        <line>recognize a little mistake. If I may take the liberty to suppose it,</line>
        <line>you, sir, are probably one of the aesthetic--or shall I rather say</line>
        <line>ecstatic?--laborers, who have planted themselves hereabouts. This is</line>
        <line>your forest of Arden; and you are either the banished Duke in person,</line>
        <line>or one of the chief nobles in his train. The melancholy Jacques,</line>
        <line>perhaps? Be it so. In that case, you can probably do me a favor."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I never, in my life, felt less inclined to confer a favor on any man.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I am busy," said I.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>So unexpectedly had the stranger made me sensible of his presence, that</line>
        <line>he had almost the effect of an apparition; and certainly a less</line>
        <line>appropriate one (taking into view the dim woodland solitude about us)</line>
        <line>than if the salvage man of antiquity, hirsute and cinctured with a</line>
        <line>leafy girdle, had started out of a thicket. He was still young,</line>
        <line>seemingly a little under thirty, of a tall and well-developed figure,</line>
        <line>and as handsome a man as ever I beheld. The style of his beauty,</line>
        <line>however, though a masculine style, did not at all commend itself to my</line>
        <line>taste. His countenance--I hardly know how to describe the</line>
        <line>peculiarity--had an indecorum in it, a kind of rudeness, a hard,</line>
        <line>coarse, forth-putting freedom of expression, which no degree of</line>
        <line>external polish could have abated one single jot. Not that it was</line>
        <line>vulgar. But he had no fineness of nature; there was in his eyes</line>
        <line>(although they might have artifice enough of another sort) the naked</line>
        <line>exposure of something that ought not to be left prominent. With these</line>
        <line>vague allusions to what I have seen in other faces as well as his, I</line>
        <line>leave the quality to be comprehended best--because with an intuitive</line>
        <line>repugnance--by those who possess least of it.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>His hair, as well as his beard and mustache, was coal-black; his eyes,</line>
        <line>too, were black and sparkling, and his teeth remarkably brilliant. He</line>
        <line>was rather carelessly but well and fashionably dressed, in a</line>
        <line>summer-morning costume. There was a gold chain, exquisitely wrought,</line>
        <line>across his vest. I never saw a smoother or whiter gloss than that upon</line>
        <line>his shirt-bosom, which had a pin in it, set with a gem that glimmered,</line>
        <line>in the leafy shadow where he stood, like a living tip of fire. He</line>
        <line>carried a stick with a wooden head, carved in vivid imitation of that</line>
        <line>of a serpent. I hated him, partly, I do believe, from a comparison of</line>
        <line>my own homely garb with his well-ordered foppishness.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, sir," said I, a little ashamed of my first irritation, but still</line>
        <line>with no waste of civility, "be pleased to speak at once, as I have my</line>
        <line>own business in hand."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I regret that my mode of addressing you was a little unfortunate,"</line>
        <line>said the stranger, smiling; for he seemed a very acute sort of person,</line>
        <line>and saw, in some degree, how I stood affected towards him. "I intended</line>
        <line>no offence, and shall certainly comport myself with due ceremony</line>
        <line>hereafter. I merely wish to make a few inquiries respecting a lady,</line>
        <line>formerly of my acquaintance, who is now resident in your Community,</line>
        <line>and, I believe, largely concerned in your social enterprise. You call</line>
        <line>her, I think, Zenobia."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"That is her name in literature," observed I; "a name, too, which</line>
        <line>possibly she may permit her private friends to know and address her</line>
        <line>by,--but not one which they feel at liberty to recognize when used of</line>
        <line>her personally by a stranger or casual acquaintance."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Indeed!" answered this disagreeable person; and he turned aside his</line>
        <line>face for an instant with a brief laugh, which struck me as a noteworthy</line>
        <line>expression of his character. "Perhaps I might put forward a claim, on</line>
        <line>your own grounds, to call the lady by a name so appropriate to her</line>
        <line>splendid qualities. But I am willing to know her by any cognomen that</line>
        <line>you may suggest."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Heartily wishing that he would be either a little more offensive, or a</line>
        <line>good deal less so, or break off our intercourse altogether, I mentioned</line>
        <line>Zenobia's real name.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"True," said he; "and in general society I have never heard her called</line>
        <line>otherwise. And, after all, our discussion of the point has been</line>
        <line>gratuitous. My object is only to inquire when, where, and how this</line>
        <line>lady may most conveniently be seen."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"At her present residence, of course," I replied. "You have but to go</line>
        <line>thither and ask for her. This very path will lead you within sight of</line>
        <line>the house; so I wish you good-morning."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"One moment, if you please," said the stranger. "The course you</line>
        <line>indicate would certainly be the proper one, in an ordinary morning</line>
        <line>call. But my business is private, personal, and somewhat peculiar.</line>
        <line>Now, in a community like this, I should judge that any little</line>
        <line>occurrence is likely to be discussed rather more minutely than would</line>
        <line>quite suit my views. I refer solely to myself, you understand, and</line>
        <line>without intimating that it would be other than a matter of entire</line>
        <line>indifference to the lady. In short, I especially desire to see her in</line>
        <line>private. If her habits are such as I have known them, she is probably</line>
        <line>often to be met with in the woods, or by the river-side; and I think</line>
        <line>you could do me the favor to point out some favorite walk, where, about</line>
        <line>this hour, I might be fortunate enough to gain an interview."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I reflected that it would be quite a supererogatory piece of Quixotism</line>
        <line>in me to undertake the guardianship of Zenobia, who, for my pains,</line>
        <line>would only make me the butt of endless ridicule, should the fact ever</line>
        <line>come to her knowledge. I therefore described a spot which, as often as</line>
        <line>any other, was Zenobia's resort at this period of the day; nor was it</line>
        <line>so remote from the farmhouse as to leave her in much peril, whatever</line>
        <line>might be the stranger's character.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"A single word more," said he; and his black eyes sparkled at me,</line>
        <line>whether with fun or malice I knew not, but certainly as if the Devil</line>
        <line>were peeping out of them. "Among your fraternity, I understand, there</line>
        <line>is a certain holy and benevolent blacksmith; a man of iron, in more</line>
        <line>senses than one; a rough, cross-grained, well-meaning individual,</line>
        <line>rather boorish in his manners, as might be expected, and by no means of</line>
        <line>the highest intellectual cultivation. He is a philanthropical</line>
        <line>lecturer, with two or three disciples, and a scheme of his own, the</line>
        <line>preliminary step in which involves a large purchase of land, and the</line>
        <line>erection of a spacious edifice, at an expense considerably beyond his</line>
        <line>means; inasmuch as these are to be reckoned in copper or old iron much</line>
        <line>more conveniently than in gold or silver. He hammers away upon his one</line>
        <line>topic as lustily as ever he did upon a horseshoe! Do you know such a</line>
        <line>person?" I shook my head, and was turning away. "Our friend," he</line>
        <line>continued, "is described to me as a brawny, shaggy, grim, and</line>
        <line>ill-favored personage, not particularly well calculated, one would say,</line>
        <line>to insinuate himself with the softer sex. Yet, so far has this honest</line>
        <line>fellow succeeded with one lady whom we wot of, that he anticipates,</line>
        <line>from her abundant resources, the necessary funds for realizing his plan</line>
        <line>in brick and mortar!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Here the stranger seemed to be so much amused with his sketch of</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's character and purposes, that he burst into a fit of</line>
        <line>merriment, of the same nature as the brief, metallic laugh already</line>
        <line>alluded to, but immensely prolonged and enlarged. In the excess of his</line>
        <line>delight, he opened his mouth wide, and disclosed a gold band around the</line>
        <line>upper part of his teeth, thereby making it apparent that every one of</line>
        <line>his brilliant grinders and incisors was a sham. This discovery</line>
        <line>affected me very oddly.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I felt as if the whole man were a moral and physical humbug; his</line>
        <line>wonderful beauty of face, for aught I knew, might be removable like a</line>
        <line>mask; and, tall and comely as his figure looked, he was perhaps but a</line>
        <line>wizened little elf, gray and decrepit, with nothing genuine about him</line>
        <line>save the wicked expression of his grin. The fantasy of his spectral</line>
        <line>character so wrought upon me, together with the contagion of his</line>
        <line>strange mirth on my sympathies, that I soon began to laugh as loudly as</line>
        <line>himself.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>By and by, he paused all at once; so suddenly, indeed, that my own</line>
        <line>cachinnation lasted a moment longer.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, excuse me!" said he. "Our interview seems to proceed more merrily</line>
        <line>than it began."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It ends here," answered "And I take shame to myself that my folly</line>
        <line>has lost me the right of resenting your ridicule of a friend."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Pray allow me," said the stranger, approaching a step nearer, and</line>
        <line>laying his gloved hand on my sleeve. "One other favor I must ask of</line>
        <line>you. You have a young person here at Blithedale, of whom I have</line>
        <line>heard,--whom, perhaps, I have known,--and in whom, at all events, I</line>
        <line>take a peculiar interest. She is one of those delicate, nervous young</line>
        <line>creatures, not uncommon in New England, and whom I suppose to have</line>
        <line>become what we find them by the gradual refining away of the physical</line>
        <line>system among your women. Some philosophers choose to glorify this</line>
        <line>habit of body by terming it spiritual; but, in my opinion, it is rather</line>
        <line>the effect of unwholesome food, bad air, lack of outdoor exercise, and</line>
        <line>neglect of bathing, on the part of these damsels and their female</line>
        <line>progenitors, all resulting in a kind of hereditary dyspepsia. Zenobia,</line>
        <line>even with her uncomfortable surplus of vitality, is far the better</line>
        <line>model of womanhood. But--to revert again to this young person--she</line>
        <line>goes among you by the name of Priscilla. Could you possibly afford me</line>
        <line>the means of speaking with her?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You have made so many inquiries of me," I observed, "that I may at</line>
        <line>least trouble you with one. What is your name?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>He offered me a card, with "Professor Westervelt" engraved on it. At</line>
        <line>the same time, as if to vindicate his claim to the professorial</line>
        <line>dignity, so often assumed on very questionable grounds, he put on a</line>
        <line>pair of spectacles, which so altered the character of his face that I</line>
        <line>hardly knew him again. But I liked the present aspect no better than</line>
        <line>the former one.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I must decline any further connection with your affairs," said I,</line>
        <line>drawing back. "I have told you where to find Zenobia. As for</line>
        <line>Priscilla, she has closer friends than myself, through whom, if they</line>
        <line>see fit, you can gain access to her."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"In that case," returned the Professor, ceremoniously raising his hat,</line>
        <line>"good-morning to you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>He took his departure, and was soon out of sight among the windings of</line>
        <line>the wood-path. But after a little reflection, I could not help</line>
        <line>regretting that I had so peremptorily broken off the interview, while</line>
        <line>the stranger seemed inclined to continue it. His evident knowledge of</line>
        <line>matters affecting my three friends might have led to disclosures or</line>
        <line>inferences that would perhaps have been serviceable. I was</line>
        <line>particularly struck with the fact that, ever since the appearance of</line>
        <line>Priscilla, it had been the tendency of events to suggest and establish</line>
        <line>a connection between Zenobia and her. She had come, in the first</line>
        <line>instance, as if with the sole purpose of claiming Zenobia's protection.</line>
        <line>Old Moodie's visit, it appeared, was chiefly to ascertain whether this</line>
        <line>object had been accomplished. And here, to-day, was the questionable</line>
        <line>Professor, linking one with the other in his inquiries, and seeking</line>
        <line>communication with both.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Meanwhile, my inclination for a ramble having been balked, I lingered</line>
        <line>in the vicinity of the farm, with perhaps a vague idea that some new</line>
        <line>event would grow out of Westervelt's proposed interview with Zenobia.</line>
        <line>My own part in these transactions was singularly subordinate. It</line>
        <line>resembled that of the Chorus in a classic play, which seems to be set</line>
        <line>aloof from the possibility of personal concernment, and bestows the</line>
        <line>whole measure of its hope or fear, its exultation or sorrow, on the</line>
        <line>fortunes of others, between whom and itself this sympathy is the only</line>
        <line>bond. Destiny, it may be,--the most skilful of stage managers,--seldom</line>
        <line>chooses to arrange its scenes, and carry forward its drama, without</line>
        <line>securing the presence of at least one calm observer. It is his office</line>
        <line>to give applause when due, and sometimes an inevitable tear, to detect</line>
        <line>the final fitness of incident to character, and distil in his</line>
        <line>long-brooding thought the whole morality of the performance.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Not to be out of the way in case there were need of me in my vocation,</line>
        <line>and, at the same time, to avoid thrusting myself where neither destiny</line>
        <line>nor mortals might desire my presence, I remained pretty near the verge</line>
        <line>of the woodlands. My position was off the track of Zenobia's customary</line>
        <line>walk, yet not so remote but that a recognized occasion might speedily</line>
        <line>have brought me thither.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>COVERDALE'S HERMITAGE</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Long since, in this part of our circumjacent wood, I had found out for</line>
        <line>myself a little hermitage. It was a kind of leafy cave, high upward</line>
        <line>into the air, among the midmost branches of a white-pine tree. A wild</line>
        <line>grapevine, of unusual size and luxuriance, had twined and twisted</line>
        <line>itself up into the tree, and, after wreathing the entanglement of its</line>
        <line>tendrils around almost every bough, had caught hold of three or four</line>
        <line>neighboring trees, and married the whole clump with a perfectly</line>
        <line>inextricable knot of polygamy. Once, while sheltering myself from a</line>
        <line>summer shower, the fancy had taken me to clamber up into this seemingly</line>
        <line>impervious mass of foliage. The branches yielded me a passage, and</line>
        <line>closed again beneath, as if only a squirrel or a bird had passed. Far</line>
        <line>aloft, around the stem of the central pine, behold a perfect nest for</line>
        <line>Robinson Crusoe or King Charles! A hollow chamber of rare seclusion</line>
        <line>had been formed by the decay of some of the pine branches, which the</line>
        <line>vine had lovingly strangled with its embrace, burying them from the</line>
        <line>light of day in an aerial sepulchre of its own leaves. It cost me but</line>
        <line>little ingenuity to enlarge the interior, and open loopholes through</line>
        <line>the verdant walls. Had it ever been my fortune to spend a honeymoon, I</line>
        <line>should have thought seriously of inviting my bride up thither, where</line>
        <line>our next neighbors would have been two orioles in another part of the</line>
        <line>clump.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It was an admirable place to make verses, tuning the rhythm to the</line>
        <line>breezy symphony that so often stirred among the vine leaves; or to</line>
        <line>meditate an essay for "The Dial," in which the many tongues of Nature</line>
        <line>whispered mysteries, and seemed to ask only a little stronger puff of</line>
        <line>wind to speak out the solution of its riddle. Being so pervious to</line>
        <line>air-currents, it was just the nook, too, for the enjoyment of a cigar.</line>
        <line>This hermitage was my one exclusive possession while I counted myself a</line>
        <line>brother of the socialists. It symbolized my individuality, and aided</line>
        <line>me in keeping it inviolate. None ever found me out in it, except,</line>
        <line>once, a squirrel. I brought thither no guest, because, after</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth failed me, there was no longer the man alive with whom I</line>
        <line>could think of sharing all. So there I used to sit, owl-like, yet not</line>
        <line>without liberal and hospitable thoughts. I counted the innumerable</line>
        <line>clusters of my vine, and fore-reckoned the abundance of my vintage. It</line>
        <line>gladdened me to anticipate the surprise of the Community, when, like an</line>
        <line>allegorical figure of rich October, I should make my appearance, with</line>
        <line>shoulders bent beneath the burden of ripe grapes, and some of the</line>
        <line>crushed ones crimsoning my brow as with a bloodstain.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Ascending into this natural turret, I peeped in turn out of several of</line>
        <line>its small windows. The pine-tree, being ancient, rose high above the</line>
        <line>rest of the wood, which was of comparatively recent growth. Even where</line>
        <line>I sat, about midway between the root and the topmost bough, my position</line>
        <line>was lofty enough to serve as an observatory, not for starry</line>
        <line>investigations, but for those sublunary matters in which lay a lore as</line>
        <line>infinite as that of the planets. Through one loophole I saw the river</line>
        <line>lapsing calmly onward, while in the meadow, near its brink, a few of</line>
        <line>the brethren were digging peat for our winter's fuel. On the interior</line>
        <line>cart-road of our farm I discerned Hollingsworth, with a yoke of oxen</line>
        <line>hitched to a drag of stones, that were to be piled into a fence, on</line>
        <line>which we employed ourselves at the odd intervals of other labor. The</line>
        <line>harsh tones of his voice, shouting to the sluggish steers, made me</line>
        <line>sensible, even at such a distance, that he was ill at ease, and that</line>
        <line>the balked philanthropist had the battle-spirit in his heart.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Haw, Buck!" quoth he. "Come along there, ye lazy ones! What are ye</line>
        <line>about, now? Gee!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Mankind, in Hollingsworth's opinion," thought I, "is but another yoke</line>
        <line>of oxen, as stubborn, stupid, and sluggish as our old Brown and Bright.</line>
        <line>He vituperates us aloud, and curses us in his heart, and will begin to</line>
        <line>prick us with the goad-stick, by and by. But are we his oxen? And</line>
        <line>what right has he to be the driver? And why, when there is enough else</line>
        <line>to do, should we waste our strength in dragging home the ponderous load</line>
        <line>of his philanthropic absurdities? At my height above the earth, the</line>
        <line>whole matter looks ridiculous!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Turning towards the farmhouse, I saw Priscilla (for, though a great way</line>
        <line>off, the eye of faith assured me that it was she) sitting at Zenobia's</line>
        <line>window, and making little purses, I suppose; or, perhaps, mending the</line>
        <line>Community's old linen. A bird flew past my tree; and, as it clove its</line>
        <line>way onward into the sunny atmosphere, I flung it a message for</line>
        <line>Priscilla.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Tell her," said I, "that her fragile thread of life has inextricably</line>
        <line>knotted itself with other and tougher threads, and most likely it will</line>
        <line>be broken. Tell her that Zenobia will not be long her friend. Say that</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's heart is on fire with his own purpose, but icy for all</line>
        <line>human affection; and that, if she has given him her love, it is like</line>
        <line>casting a flower into a sepulchre. And say that if any mortal really</line>
        <line>cares for her, it is myself; and not even I for her realities,--poor</line>
        <line>little seamstress, as Zenobia rightly called her!--but for the</line>
        <line>fancy-work with which I have idly decked her out!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The pleasant scent of the wood, evolved by the hot sun, stole up to my</line>
        <line>nostrils, as if I had been an idol in its niche. Many trees mingled</line>
        <line>their fragrance into a thousand-fold odor. Possibly there was a</line>
        <line>sensual influence in the broad light of noon that lay beneath me. It</line>
        <line>may have been the cause, in part, that I suddenly found myself</line>
        <line>possessed by a mood of disbelief in moral beauty or heroism, and a</line>
        <line>conviction of the folly of attempting to benefit the world. Our</line>
        <line>especial scheme of reform, which, from my observatory, I could take in</line>
        <line>with the bodily eye, looked so ridiculous that it was impossible not to</line>
        <line>laugh aloud.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"But the joke is a little too heavy," thought "If I were wise, I</line>
        <line>should get out of the scrape with all diligence, and then laugh at my</line>
        <line>companions for remaining in it."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>While thus musing, I heard with perfect distinctness, somewhere in the</line>
        <line>wood beneath, the peculiar laugh which I have described as one of the</line>
        <line>disagreeable characteristics of Professor Westervelt. It brought my</line>
        <line>thoughts back to our recent interview. I recognized as chiefly due to</line>
        <line>this man's influence the sceptical and sneering view which just now had</line>
        <line>filled my mental vision in regard to all life's better purposes. And</line>
        <line>it was through his eyes, more than my own, that I was looking at</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, with his glorious if impracticable dream, and at the</line>
        <line>noble earthliness of Zenobia's character, and even at Priscilla, whose</line>
        <line>impalpable grace lay so singularly between disease and beauty. The</line>
        <line>essential charm of each had vanished. There are some spheres the</line>
        <line>contact with which inevitably degrades the high, debases the pure,</line>
        <line>deforms the beautiful. It must be a mind of uncommon strength, and</line>
        <line>little impressibility, that can permit itself the habit of such</line>
        <line>intercourse, and not be permanently deteriorated; and yet the</line>
        <line>Professor's tone represented that of worldly society at large, where a</line>
        <line>cold scepticism smothers what it can of our spiritual aspirations, and</line>
        <line>makes the rest ridiculous. I detested this kind of man; and all the</line>
        <line>more because a part of my own nature showed itself responsive to him.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Voices were now approaching through the region of the wood which lay in</line>
        <line>the vicinity of my tree. Soon I caught glimpses of two figures--a</line>
        <line>woman and a man--Zenobia and the stranger--earnestly talking together</line>
        <line>as they advanced.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia had a rich though varying color. It was, most of the while, a</line>
        <line>flame, and anon a sudden paleness. Her eyes glowed, so that their</line>
        <line>light sometimes flashed upward to me, as when the sun throws a dazzle</line>
        <line>from some bright object on the ground. Her gestures were free, and</line>
        <line>strikingly impressive. The whole woman was alive with a passionate</line>
        <line>intensity, which I now perceived to be the phase in which her beauty</line>
        <line>culminated. Any passion would have become her well; and passionate</line>
        <line>love, perhaps, the best of all. This was not love, but anger, largely</line>
        <line>intermixed with scorn. Yet the idea strangely forced itself upon me,</line>
        <line>that there was a sort of familiarity between these two companions,</line>
        <line>necessarily the result of an intimate love,--on Zenobia's part, at</line>
        <line>least,--in days gone by, but which had prolonged itself into as</line>
        <line>intimate a hatred, for all futurity. As they passed among the trees,</line>
        <line>reckless as her movement was, she took good heed that even the hem of</line>
        <line>her garment should not brush against the stranger's person. I wondered</line>
        <line>whether there had always been a chasm, guarded so religiously, betwixt</line>
        <line>these two.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As for Westervelt, he was not a whit more warmed by Zenobia's passion</line>
        <line>than a salamander by the heat of its native furnace. He would have</line>
        <line>been absolutely statuesque, save for a look of slight perplexity,</line>
        <line>tinctured strongly with derision. It was a crisis in which his</line>
        <line>intellectual perceptions could not altogether help him out. He failed</line>
        <line>to comprehend, and cared but little for comprehending, why Zenobia</line>
        <line>should put herself into such a fume; but satisfied his mind that it was</line>
        <line>all folly, and only another shape of a woman's manifold absurdity,</line>
        <line>which men can never understand. How many a woman's evil fate has yoked</line>
        <line>her with a man like this! Nature thrusts some of us into the world</line>
        <line>miserably incomplete on the emotional side, with hardly any</line>
        <line>sensibilities except what pertain to us as animals. No passion, save</line>
        <line>of the senses; no holy tenderness, nor the delicacy that results from</line>
        <line>this. Externally they bear a close resemblance to other men, and have</line>
        <line>perhaps all save the finest grace; but when a woman wrecks herself on</line>
        <line>such a being, she ultimately finds that the real womanhood within her</line>
        <line>has no corresponding part in him. Her deepest voice lacks a response;</line>
        <line>the deeper her cry, the more dead his silence. The fault may be none</line>
        <line>of his; he cannot give her what never lived within his soul. But the</line>
        <line>wretchedness on her side, and the moral deterioration attendant on a</line>
        <line>false and shallow life, without strength enough to keep itself sweet,</line>
        <line>are among the most pitiable wrongs that mortals suffer.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Now, as I looked down from my upper region at this man and</line>
        <line>woman,--outwardly so fair a sight, and wandering like two lovers in the</line>
        <line>wood,--I imagined that Zenobia, at an earlier period of youth, might</line>
        <line>have fallen into the misfortune above indicated. And when her</line>
        <line>passionate womanhood, as was inevitable, had discovered its mistake,</line>
        <line>here had ensued the character of eccentricity and defiance which</line>
        <line>distinguished the more public portion of her life.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Seeing how aptly matters had chanced thus far, I began to think it the</line>
        <line>design of fate to let me into all Zenobia's secrets, and that therefore</line>
        <line>the couple would sit down beneath my tree, and carry on a conversation</line>
        <line>which would leave me nothing to inquire. No doubt, however, had it so</line>
        <line>happened, I should have deemed myself honorably bound to warn them of a</line>
        <line>listener's presence by flinging down a handful of unripe grapes, or by</line>
        <line>sending an unearthly groan out of my hiding-place, as if this were one</line>
        <line>of the trees of Dante's ghostly forest. But real life never arranges</line>
        <line>itself exactly like a romance. In the first place, they did not sit</line>
        <line>down at all. Secondly, even while they passed beneath the tree,</line>
        <line>Zenobia's utterance was so hasty and broken, and Westervelt's so cool</line>
        <line>and low, that I hardly could make out an intelligible sentence on</line>
        <line>either side. What I seem to remember, I yet suspect, may have been</line>
        <line>patched together by my fancy, in brooding over the matter afterwards.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Why not fling the girl off," said Westervelt, "and let her go?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"She clung to me from the first," replied Zenobia. "I neither know nor</line>
        <line>care what it is in me that so attaches her. But she loves me, and I</line>
        <line>will not fail her."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"She will plague you, then," said he, "in more ways than one."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"The poor child!" exclaimed Zenobia. "She can do me neither good nor</line>
        <line>harm. How should she?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I know not what reply Westervelt whispered; nor did Zenobia's</line>
        <line>subsequent exclamation give me any clew, except that it evidently</line>
        <line>inspired her with horror and disgust.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"With what kind of a being am I linked?" cried she. "If my Creator</line>
        <line>cares aught for my soul, let him release me from this miserable bond!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I did not think it weighed so heavily," said her companion..</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Nevertheless," answered Zenobia, "it will strangle me at last!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And then I heard her utter a helpless sort of moan; a sound which,</line>
        <line>struggling out of the heart of a person of her pride and strength,</line>
        <line>affected me more than if she had made the wood dolorously vocal with a</line>
        <line>thousand shrieks and wails.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Other mysterious words, besides what are above written, they spoke</line>
        <line>together; but I understood no more, and even question whether I fairly</line>
        <line>understood so much as this. By long brooding over our recollections,</line>
        <line>we subtilize them into something akin to imaginary stuff, and hardly</line>
        <line>capable of being distinguished from it. In a few moments they were</line>
        <line>completely beyond ear-shot. A breeze stirred after them, and awoke the</line>
        <line>leafy tongues of the surrounding trees, which forthwith began to</line>
        <line>babble, as if innumerable gossips had all at once got wind of Zenobia's</line>
        <line>secret. But, as the breeze grew stronger, its voice among the branches</line>
        <line>was as if it said, "Hush! Hush!" and I resolved that to no mortal</line>
        <line>would I disclose what I had heard. And, though there might be room for</line>
        <line>casuistry, such, I conceive, is the most equitable rule in all similar</line>
        <line>conjunctures.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>ZENOBIA'S LEGEND</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The illustrious Society of Blithedale, though it toiled in downright</line>
        <line>earnest for the good of mankind, yet not unfrequently illuminated its</line>
        <line>laborious life with an afternoon or evening of pastime. Picnics under</line>
        <line>the trees were considerably in vogue; and, within doors, fragmentary</line>
        <line>bits of theatrical performance, such as single acts of tragedy or</line>
        <line>comedy, or dramatic proverbs and charades. Zenobia, besides, was fond</line>
        <line>of giving us readings from Shakespeare, and often with a depth of</line>
        <line>tragic power, or breadth of comic effect, that made one feel it an</line>
        <line>intolerable wrong to the world that she did not at once go upon the</line>
        <line>stage. Tableaux vivants were another of our occasional modes of</line>
        <line>amusement, in which scarlet shawls, old silken robes, ruffs, velvets,</line>
        <line>furs, and all kinds of miscellaneous trumpery converted our familiar</line>
        <line>companions into the people of a pictorial world. We had been thus</line>
        <line>engaged on the evening after the incident narrated in the last chapter.</line>
        <line>Several splendid works of art--either arranged after engravings from</line>
        <line>the old masters, or original illustrations of scenes in history or</line>
        <line>romance--had been presented, and we were earnestly entreating Zenobia</line>
        <line>for more.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She stood with a meditative air, holding a large piece of gauze, or</line>
        <line>some such ethereal stuff, as if considering what picture should next</line>
        <line>occupy the frame; while at her feet lay a heap of many-colored</line>
        <line>garments, which her quick fancy and magic skill could so easily convert</line>
        <line>into gorgeous draperies for heroes and princesses.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I am getting weary of this," said she, after a moment's thought. "Our</line>
        <line>own features, and our own figures and airs, show a little too</line>
        <line>intrusively through all the characters we assume. We have so much</line>
        <line>familiarity with one another's realities, that we cannot remove</line>
        <line>ourselves, at pleasure, into an imaginary sphere. Let us have no more</line>
        <line>pictures to-night; but, to make you what poor amends I can, how would</line>
        <line>you like to have me trump up a wild, spectral legend, on the spur of</line>
        <line>the moment?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia had the gift of telling a fanciful little story, off-hand, in a</line>
        <line>way that made it greatly more effective than it was usually found to be</line>
        <line>when she afterwards elaborated the same production with her pen. Her</line>
        <line>proposal, therefore, was greeted with acclamation.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Oh, a story, a story, by all means!" cried the young girls. "No</line>
        <line>matter how marvellous; we will believe it, every word. And let it be a</line>
        <line>ghost story, if you please."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No, not exactly a ghost story," answered Zenobia; "but something so</line>
        <line>nearly like it that you shall hardly tell the difference. And,</line>
        <line>Priscilla, stand you before me, where I may look at you, and get my</line>
        <line>inspiration out of your eyes. They are very deep and dreamy to-night."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I know not whether the following version of her story will retain any</line>
        <line>portion of its pristine character; but, as Zenobia told it wildly and</line>
        <line>rapidly, hesitating at no extravagance, and dashing at absurdities</line>
        <line>which I am too timorous to repeat,--giving it the varied emphasis of</line>
        <line>her inimitable voice, and the pictorial illustration of her mobile</line>
        <line>face, while through it all we caught the freshest aroma of the</line>
        <line>thoughts, as they came bubbling out of her mind,--thus narrated, and</line>
        <line>thus heard, the legend seemed quite a remarkable affair. I scarcely</line>
        <line>knew, at the time, whether she intended us to laugh or be more</line>
        <line>seriously impressed. From beginning to end, it was undeniable</line>
        <line>nonsense, but not necessarily the worse for that.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <line>THE SILVERY VEIL</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>You have heard, my dear friends, of the Veiled Lady, who grew suddenly</line>
        <line>so very famous, a few months ago. And have you never thought how</line>
        <line>remarkable it was that this marvellous creature should vanish, all at</line>
        <line>once, while her renown was on the increase, before the public had grown</line>
        <line>weary of her, and when the enigma of her character, instead of being</line>
        <line>solved, presented itself more mystically at every exhibition? Her last</line>
        <line>appearance, as you know, was before a crowded audience. The next</line>
        <line>evening,--although the bills had announced her, at the corner of every</line>
        <line>street, in red letters of a gigantic size,--there was no Veiled Lady to</line>
        <line>be seen! Now, listen to my simple little tale, and you shall hear the</line>
        <line>very latest incident in the known life--(if life it may be called,</line>
        <line>which seemed to have no more reality than the candle-light image of</line>
        <line>one's self which peeps at us outside of a dark windowpane)--the life of</line>
        <line>this shadowy phenomenon.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>A party of young gentlemen, you are to understand, were enjoying</line>
        <line>themselves, one afternoon,--as young gentlemen are sometimes fond of</line>
        <line>doing,--over a bottle or two of champagne; and, among other ladies less</line>
        <line>mysterious, the subject of the Veiled Lady, as was very natural,</line>
        <line>happened to come up before them for discussion. She rose, as it were,</line>
        <line>with the sparkling effervescence of their wine, and appeared in a more</line>
        <line>airy and fantastic light on account of the medium through which they</line>
        <line>saw her. They repeated to one another, between jest and earnest, all</line>
        <line>the wild stories that were in vogue; nor, I presume, did they hesitate</line>
        <line>to add any small circumstance that the inventive whim of the moment</line>
        <line>might suggest, to heighten the marvellousness of their theme.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"But what an audacious report was that," observed one, "which pretended</line>
        <line>to assert the identity of this strange creature with a young</line>
        <line>lady,"--and here he mentioned her name,--"the daughter of one of our</line>
        <line>most distinguished families!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, there is more in that story than can well be accounted for,"</line>
        <line>remarked another. "I have it on good authority, that the young lady in</line>
        <line>question is invariably out of sight, and not to be traced, even by her</line>
        <line>own family, at the hours when the Veiled Lady is before the public; nor</line>
        <line>can any satisfactory explanation be given of her disappearance. And</line>
        <line>just look at the thing: Her brother is a young fellow of spirit. He</line>
        <line>cannot but be aware of these rumors in reference to his sister. Why,</line>
        <line>then, does he not come forward to defend her character, unless he is</line>
        <line>conscious that an investigation would only make the matter worse?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It is essential to the purposes of my legend to distinguish one of</line>
        <line>these young gentlemen from his companions; so, for the sake of a soft</line>
        <line>and pretty name (such as we of the literary sisterhood invariably</line>
        <line>bestow upon our heroes), I deem it fit to call him Theodore.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Pshaw!" exclaimed Theodore; "her brother is no such fool! Nobody,</line>
        <line>unless his brain be as full of bubbles as this wine, can seriously</line>
        <line>think of crediting that ridiculous rumor. Why, if my senses did not</line>
        <line>play me false (which never was the case yet), I affirm that I saw that</line>
        <line>very lady, last evening, at the exhibition, while this veiled</line>
        <line>phenomenon was playing off her juggling tricks! What can you say to</line>
        <line>that?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Oh, it was a spectral illusion that you saw!" replied his friends,</line>
        <line>with a general laugh. "The Veiled Lady is quite up to such a thing."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>However, as the above-mentioned fable could not hold its ground against</line>
        <line>Theodore's downright refutation, they went on to speak of other stories</line>
        <line>which the wild babble of the town had set afloat. Some upheld that the</line>
        <line>veil covered the most beautiful countenance in the world; others,--and</line>
        <line>certainly with more reason, considering the sex of the Veiled</line>
        <line>Lady,--that the face was the most hideous and horrible, and that this</line>
        <line>was her sole motive for hiding it. It was the face of a corpse; it was</line>
        <line>the head of a skeleton; it was a monstrous visage, with snaky locks,</line>
        <line>like Medusa's, and one great red eye in the centre of the forehead.</line>
        <line>Again, it was affirmed that there was no single and unchangeable set of</line>
        <line>features beneath the veil; but that whosoever should be bold enough to</line>
        <line>lift it would behold the features of that person, in all the world, who</line>
        <line>was destined to be his fate; perhaps he would be greeted by the tender</line>
        <line>smile of the woman whom he loved, or, quite as probably, the deadly</line>
        <line>scowl of his bitterest enemy would throw a blight over his life. They</line>
        <line>quoted, moreover, this startling explanation of the whole affair: that</line>
        <line>the magician who exhibited the Veiled Lady--and who, by the bye, was</line>
        <line>the handsomest man in the whole world--had bartered his own soul for</line>
        <line>seven years' possession of a familiar fiend, and that the last year of</line>
        <line>the contract was wearing towards its close.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>If it were worth our while, I could keep you till an hour beyond</line>
        <line>midnight listening to a thousand such absurdities as these. But</line>
        <line>finally our friend Theodore, who prided himself upon his common-sense,</line>
        <line>found the matter getting quite beyond his patience.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I offer any wager you like," cried he, setting down his glass so</line>
        <line>forcibly as to break the stem of it, "that this very evening I find out</line>
        <line>the mystery of the Veiled Lady!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Young men, I am told, boggle at nothing over their wine; so, after a</line>
        <line>little more talk, a wager of considerable amount was actually laid, the</line>
        <line>money staked, and Theodore left to choose his own method of settling</line>
        <line>the dispute.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>How he managed it I know not, nor is it of any great importance to this</line>
        <line>veracious legend. The most natural way, to be sure, was by bribing the</line>
        <line>doorkeeper,--or possibly he preferred clambering in at the window.</line>
        <line>But, at any rate, that very evening, while the exhibition was going</line>
        <line>forward in the hall, Theodore contrived to gain admittance into the</line>
        <line>private withdrawing-room whither the Veiled Lady was accustomed to</line>
        <line>retire at the close of her performances. There he waited, listening, I</line>
        <line>suppose, to the stifled hum of the great audience; and no doubt he</line>
        <line>could distinguish the deep tones of the magician, causing the wonders</line>
        <line>that he wrought to appear more dark and intricate, by his mystic</line>
        <line>pretence of an explanation. Perhaps, too, in the intervals of the wild</line>
        <line>breezy music which accompanied the exhibition, he might hear the low</line>
        <line>voice of the Veiled Lady, conveying her sibylline responses. Firm as</line>
        <line>Theodore's nerves might be, and much as he prided himself on his sturdy</line>
        <line>perception of realities, I should not be surprised if his heart</line>
        <line>throbbed at a little more than its ordinary rate.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Theodore concealed himself behind a screen. In due time the</line>
        <line>performance was brought to a close, and whether the door was softly</line>
        <line>opened, or whether her bodiless presence came through the wall, is more</line>
        <line>than I can say, but, all at once, without the young man's knowing how</line>
        <line>it happened, a veiled figure stood in the centre of the room. It was</line>
        <line>one thing to be in presence of this mystery in the hall of exhibition,</line>
        <line>where the warm, dense life of hundreds of other mortals kept up the</line>
        <line>beholder's courage, and distributed her influence among so many; it was</line>
        <line>another thing to be quite alone with her, and that, too, with a</line>
        <line>hostile, or, at least, an unauthorized and unjustifiable purpose. I</line>
        <line>further imagine that Theodore now began to be sensible of something</line>
        <line>more serious in his enterprise than he had been quite aware of while he</line>
        <line>sat with his boon-companions over their sparkling wine.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Very strange, it must be confessed, was the movement with which the</line>
        <line>figure floated to and fro over the carpet, with the silvery veil</line>
        <line>covering her from head to foot; so impalpable, so ethereal, so without</line>
        <line>substance, as the texture seemed, yet hiding her every outline in an</line>
        <line>impenetrability like that of midnight. Surely, she did not walk! She</line>
        <line>floated, and flitted, and hovered about the room; no sound of a</line>
        <line>footstep, no perceptible motion of a limb; it was as if a wandering</line>
        <line>breeze wafted her before it, at its own wild and gentle pleasure. But,</line>
        <line>by and by, a purpose began to be discernible, throughout the seeming</line>
        <line>vagueness of her unrest. She was in quest of something. Could it be</line>
        <line>that a subtile presentiment had informed her of the young man's</line>
        <line>presence? And if so, did the Veiled Lady seek or did she shun him?</line>
        <line>The doubt in Theodore's mind was speedily resolved; for, after a moment</line>
        <line>or two of these erratic flutterings, she advanced more decidedly, and</line>
        <line>stood motionless before the screen.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Thou art here!" said a soft, low voice. "Come forth, Theodore!" Thus</line>
        <line>summoned by his name, Theodore, as a man of courage, had no choice. He</line>
        <line>emerged from his concealment, and presented himself before the Veiled</line>
        <line>Lady, with the wine-flush, it may be, quite gone out of his cheeks.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What wouldst thou with me?" she inquired, with the same gentle</line>
        <line>composure that was in her former utterance.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Mysterious creature," replied Theodore, "I would know who and what you</line>
        <line>are!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"My lips are forbidden to betray the secret," said the Veiled Lady.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"At whatever risk, I must discover it," rejoined Theodore.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Then," said the Mystery, "there is no way save to lift my veil."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And Theodore, partly recovering his audacity, stept forward on the</line>
        <line>instant, to do as the Veiled Lady had suggested. But she floated</line>
        <line>backward to the opposite side of the room, as if the young man's breath</line>
        <line>had possessed power enough to waft her away.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Pause, one little instant," said the soft, low voice, "and learn the</line>
        <line>conditions of what thou art so bold to undertake. Thou canst go hence,</line>
        <line>and think of me no more; or, at thy option, thou canst lift this</line>
        <line>mysterious veil, beneath which I am a sad and lonely prisoner, in a</line>
        <line>bondage which is worse to me than death. But, before raising it, I</line>
        <line>entreat thee, in all maiden modesty, to bend forward and impress a kiss</line>
        <line>where my breath stirs the veil; and my virgin lips shall come forward</line>
        <line>to meet thy lips; and from that instant, Theodore, thou shalt be mine,</line>
        <line>and I thine, with never more a veil between us. And all the felicity</line>
        <line>of earth and of the future world shall be thine and mine together. So</line>
        <line>much may a maiden say behind the veil. If thou shrinkest from this,</line>
        <line>there is yet another way." "And what is that?" asked Theodore. "Dost</line>
        <line>thou hesitate," said the Veiled Lady, "to pledge thyself to me, by</line>
        <line>meeting these lips of mine, while the veil yet hides my face? Has not</line>
        <line>thy heart recognized me? Dost thou come hither, not in holy faith, nor</line>
        <line>with a pure and generous purpose, but in scornful scepticism and idle</line>
        <line>curiosity? Still, thou mayest lift the veil! But, from that instant,</line>
        <line>Theodore, I am doomed to be thy evil fate; nor wilt thou ever taste</line>
        <line>another breath of happiness!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There was a shade of inexpressible sadness in the utterance of these</line>
        <line>last words. But Theodore, whose natural tendency was towards</line>
        <line>scepticism, felt himself almost injured and insulted by the Veiled</line>
        <line>Lady's proposal that he should pledge himself, for life and eternity,</line>
        <line>to so questionable a creature as herself; or even that she should</line>
        <line>suggest an inconsequential kiss, taking into view the probability that</line>
        <line>her face was none of the most bewitching. A delightful idea, truly,</line>
        <line>that he should salute the lips of a dead girl, or the jaws of a</line>
        <line>skeleton, or the grinning cavity of a monster's mouth! Even should she</line>
        <line>prove a comely maiden enough in other respects, the odds were ten to</line>
        <line>one that her teeth were defective; a terrible drawback on the</line>
        <line>delectableness of a kiss.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Excuse me, fair lady," said Theodore, and I think he nearly burst into</line>
        <line>a laugh, "if I prefer to lift the veil first; and for this affair of</line>
        <line>the kiss, we may decide upon it afterwards."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Thou hast made thy choice," said the sweet, sad voice behind the veil;</line>
        <line>and there seemed a tender but unresentful sense of wrong done to</line>
        <line>womanhood by the young man's contemptuous interpretation of her offer.</line>
        <line>"I must not counsel thee to pause, although thy fate is still in thine</line>
        <line>own hand!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Grasping at the veil, he flung it upward, and caught a glimpse of a</line>
        <line>pale, lovely face beneath; just one momentary glimpse, and then the</line>
        <line>apparition vanished, and the silvery veil fluttered slowly down and lay</line>
        <line>upon the floor. Theodore was alone. Our legend leaves him there. His</line>
        <line>retribution was, to pine forever and ever for another sight of that</line>
        <line>dim, mournful face,--which might have been his life-long household</line>
        <line>fireside joy,--to desire, and waste life in a feverish quest, and never</line>
        <line>meet it more.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But what, in good sooth, had become of the Veiled Lady? Had all her</line>
        <line>existence been comprehended within that mysterious veil, and was she</line>
        <line>now annihilated? Or was she a spirit, with a heavenly essence, but</line>
        <line>which might have been tamed down to human bliss, had Theodore been</line>
        <line>brave and true enough to claim her? Hearken, my sweet friends,--and</line>
        <line>hearken, dear Priscilla,--and you shall learn the little more that</line>
        <line>Zenobia can tell you.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Just at the moment, so far as can be ascertained, when the Veiled Lady</line>
        <line>vanished, a maiden, pale and shadowy, rose up amid a knot of visionary</line>
        <line>people, who were seeking for the better life. She was so gentle and so</line>
        <line>sad,--a nameless melancholy gave her such hold upon their</line>
        <line>sympathies,--that they never thought of questioning whence she came.</line>
        <line>She might have heretofore existed, or her thin substance might have</line>
        <line>been moulded out of air at the very instant when they first beheld her.</line>
        <line>It was all one to them; they took her to their hearts. Among them was a</line>
        <line>lady to whom, more than to all the rest, this pale, mysterious girl</line>
        <line>attached herself.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But one morning the lady was wandering in the woods, and there met her</line>
        <line>a figure in an Oriental robe, with a dark beard, and holding in his</line>
        <line>hand a silvery veil. He motioned her to stay. Being a woman of some</line>
        <line>nerve, she did not shriek, nor run away, nor faint, as many ladies</line>
        <line>would have been apt to do, but stood quietly, and bade him speak. The</line>
        <line>truth was, she had seen his face before, but had never feared it,</line>
        <line>although she knew him to be a terrible magician.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Lady," said he, with a warning gesture, "you are in peril!" "Peril!"</line>
        <line>she exclaimed. "And of what nature?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"There is a certain maiden," replied the magician, "who has come out of</line>
        <line>the realm of mystery, and made herself your most intimate companion.</line>
        <line>Now, the fates have so ordained it, that, whether by her own will or</line>
        <line>no, this stranger is your deadliest enemy. In love, in worldly</line>
        <line>fortune, in all your pursuit of happiness, she is doomed to fling a</line>
        <line>blight over your prospects. There is but one possibility of thwarting</line>
        <line>her disastrous influence."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Then tell me that one method," said the lady.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Take this veil," he answered, holding forth the silvery texture. "It</line>
        <line>is a spell; it is a powerful enchantment, which I wrought for her sake,</line>
        <line>and beneath which she was once my prisoner. Throw it, at unawares,</line>
        <line>over the head of this secret foe, stamp your foot, and cry, 'Arise,</line>
        <line>Magician! Here is the Veiled Lady!' and immediately I will rise up</line>
        <line>through the earth, and seize her; and from that moment you are safe!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>So the lady took the silvery veil, which was like woven air, or like</line>
        <line>some substance airier than nothing, and that would float upward and be</line>
        <line>lost among the clouds, were she once to let it go. Returning homeward,</line>
        <line>she found the shadowy girl amid the knot of visionary</line>
        <line>transcendentalists, who were still seeking for the better life. She</line>
        <line>was joyous now, and had a rose-bloom in her cheeks, and was one of the</line>
        <line>prettiest creatures, and seemed one of the happiest, that the world</line>
        <line>could show. But the lady stole noiselessly behind her and threw the</line>
        <line>veil over her head. As the slight, ethereal texture sank inevitably</line>
        <line>down over her figure, the poor girl strove to raise it, and met her</line>
        <line>dear friend's eyes with one glance of mortal terror, and deep, deep</line>
        <line>reproach. It could not change her purpose.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Arise, Magician!" she exclaimed, stamping her foot upon the earth.</line>
        <line>"Here is the Veiled Lady!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>At the word, up rose the bearded man in the Oriental robes,--the</line>
        <line>beautiful, the dark magician, who had bartered away his soul! He threw</line>
        <line>his arms around the Veiled Lady, and she was his bond-slave for</line>
        <line>evermore!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia, all this while, had been holding the piece of gauze, and so</line>
        <line>managed it as greatly to increase the dramatic effect of the legend at</line>
        <line>those points where the magic veil was to be described. Arriving at the</line>
        <line>catastrophe, and uttering the fatal words, she flung the gauze over</line>
        <line>Priscilla's head; and for an instant her auditors held their breath,</line>
        <line>half expecting, I verily believe, that the magician would start up</line>
        <line>through the floor, and carry off our poor little friend before our eyes.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As for Priscilla, she stood droopingly in the midst of us, making no</line>
        <line>attempt to remove the veil.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"How do you find yourself, my love?" said Zenobia, lifting a corner of</line>
        <line>the gauze, and peeping beneath it with a mischievous smile. "Ah, the</line>
        <line>dear little soul! Why, she is really going to faint! Mr. Coverdale,</line>
        <line>Mr. Coverdale, pray bring a glass of water!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Her nerves being none of the strongest, Priscilla hardly recovered her</line>
        <line>equanimity during the rest of the evening. This, to be sure, was a</line>
        <line>great pity; but, nevertheless, we thought it a very bright idea of</line>
        <line>Zenobia's to bring her legend to so effective a conclusion.</line>
    </p>

    <p>
        <title>ELIOT'S PULPIT</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Our Sundays at Blithedale were not ordinarily kept with such rigid</line>
        <line>observance as might have befitted the descendants of the Pilgrims,</line>
        <line>whose high enterprise, as we sometimes flattered ourselves, we had</line>
        <line>taken up, and were carrying it onward and aloft, to a point which they</line>
        <line>never dreamed of attaining.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>On that hallowed day, it is true, we rested from our labors. Our oxen,</line>
        <line>relieved from their week-day yoke, roamed at large through the pasture;</line>
        <line>each yoke-fellow, however, keeping close beside his mate, and</line>
        <line>continuing to acknowledge, from the force of habit and sluggish</line>
        <line>sympathy, the union which the taskmaster had imposed for his own hard</line>
        <line>ends. As for us human yoke-fellows, chosen companions of toil, whose</line>
        <line>hoes had clinked together throughout the week, we wandered off, in</line>
        <line>various directions, to enjoy our interval of repose. Some, I believe,</line>
        <line>went devoutly to the village church. Others, it may be, ascended a</line>
        <line>city or a country pulpit, wearing the clerical robe with so much</line>
        <line>dignity that you would scarcely have suspected the yeoman's frock to</line>
        <line>have been flung off only since milking-time. Others took long rambles</line>
        <line>among the rustic lanes and by-paths, pausing to look at black old</line>
        <line>farmhouses, with their sloping roofs; and at the modern cottage, so</line>
        <line>like a plaything that it seemed as if real joy or sorrow could have no</line>
        <line>scope within; and at the more pretending villa, with its range of</line>
        <line>wooden columns supporting the needless insolence of a great portico.</line>
        <line>Some betook themselves into the wide, dusky barn, and lay there for</line>
        <line>hours together on the odorous hay; while the sunstreaks and the shadows</line>
        <line>strove together,--these to make the barn solemn, those to make it</line>
        <line>cheerful,--and both were conquerors; and the swallows twittered a</line>
        <line>cheery anthem, flashing into sight, or vanishing as they darted to and</line>
        <line>fro among the golden rules of sunshine. And others went a little way</line>
        <line>into the woods, and threw themselves on mother earth, pillowing their</line>
        <line>heads on a heap of moss, the green decay of an old log; and, dropping</line>
        <line>asleep, the bumblebees and mosquitoes sung and buzzed about their ears,</line>
        <line>causing the slumberers to twitch and start, without awaking.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>With Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla, and myself, it grew to be a</line>
        <line>custom to spend the Sabbath afternoon at a certain rock. It was known</line>
        <line>to us under the name of Eliot's pulpit, from a tradition that the</line>
        <line>venerable Apostle Eliot had preached there, two centuries gone by, to</line>
        <line>an Indian auditory. The old pine forest, through which the Apostle's</line>
        <line>voice was wont to sound, had fallen an immemorial time ago. But the</line>
        <line>soil, being of the rudest and most broken surface, had apparently never</line>
        <line>been brought under tillage; other growths, maple and beech and birch,</line>
        <line>had succeeded to the primeval trees; so that it was still as wild a</line>
        <line>tract of woodland as the great-great-great-great grandson of one of</line>
        <line>Eliot's Indians (had any such posterity been in existence) could have</line>
        <line>desired for the site and shelter of his wigwam. These after-growths,</line>
        <line>indeed, lose the stately solemnity of the original forest. If left in</line>
        <line>due neglect, however, they run into an entanglement of softer wildness,</line>
        <line>among the rustling leaves of which the sun can scatter cheerfulness as</line>
        <line>it never could among the dark-browed pines.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The rock itself rose some twenty or thirty feet, a shattered granite</line>
        <line>bowlder, or heap of bowlders, with an irregular outline and many</line>
        <line>fissures, out of which sprang shrubs, bushes, and even trees; as if the</line>
        <line>scanty soil within those crevices were sweeter to their roots than any</line>
        <line>other earth. At the base of the pulpit, the broken bowlders inclined</line>
        <line>towards each other, so as to form a shallow cave, within which our</line>
        <line>little party had sometimes found protection from a summer shower. On</line>
        <line>the threshold, or just across it, grew a tuft of pale columbines, in</line>
        <line>their season, and violets, sad and shadowy recluses, such as Priscilla</line>
        <line>was when we first knew her; children of the sun, who had never seen</line>
        <line>their father, but dwelt among damp mosses, though not akin to them. At</line>
        <line>the summit, the rock was overshadowed by the canopy of a birch-tree,</line>
        <line>which served as a sounding-board for the pulpit. Beneath this shade</line>
        <line>(with my eyes of sense half shut and those of the imagination widely</line>
        <line>opened) I used to see the holy Apostle of the Indians, with the</line>
        <line>sunlight flickering down upon him through the leaves, and glorifying</line>
        <line>his figure as with the half-perceptible glow of a transfiguration.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I the more minutely describe the rock, and this little Sabbath</line>
        <line>solitude, because Hollingsworth, at our solicitation, often ascended</line>
        <line>Eliot's pulpit, and not exactly preached, but talked to us, his few</line>
        <line>disciples, in a strain that rose and fell as naturally as the wind's</line>
        <line>breath among the leaves of the birch-tree. No other speech of man has</line>
        <line>ever moved me like some of those discourses. It seemed most pitiful--a</line>
        <line>positive calamity to the world--that a treasury of golden thoughts</line>
        <line>should thus be scattered, by the liberal handful, down among us three,</line>
        <line>when a thousand hearers might have been the richer for them; and</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth the richer, likewise, by the sympathy of multitudes.</line>
        <line>After speaking much or little, as might happen, he would descend from</line>
        <line>his gray pulpit, and generally fling himself at full length on the</line>
        <line>ground, face downward. Meanwhile, we talked around him on such topics</line>
        <line>as were suggested by the discourse.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Since her interview with Westervelt, Zenobia's continual inequalities</line>
        <line>of temper had been rather difficult for her friends to bear. On the</line>
        <line>first Sunday after that incident, when Hollingsworth had clambered down</line>
        <line>from Eliot's pulpit, she declaimed with great earnestness and passion,</line>
        <line>nothing short of anger, on the injustice which the world did to women,</line>
        <line>and equally to itself, by not allowing them, in freedom and honor, and</line>
        <line>with the fullest welcome, their natural utterance in public.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It shall not always be so!" cried she. "If I live another year, I</line>
        <line>will lift up my own voice in behalf of woman's wider liberty!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She perhaps saw me smile.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What matter of ridicule do you find in this, Miles Coverdale?"</line>
        <line>exclaimed Zenobia, with a flash of anger in her eyes. "That smile,</line>
        <line>permit me to say, makes me suspicious of a low tone of feeling and</line>
        <line>shallow thought. It is my belief--yes, and my prophecy, should I die</line>
        <line>before it happens--that, when my sex shall achieve its rights, there</line>
        <line>will be ten eloquent women where there is now one eloquent man. Thus</line>
        <line>far, no woman in the world has ever once spoken out her whole heart and</line>
        <line>her whole mind. The mistrust and disapproval of the vast bulk of</line>
        <line>society throttles us, as with two gigantic hands at our throats! We</line>
        <line>mumble a few weak words, and leave a thousand better ones unsaid. You</line>
        <line>let us write a little, it is true, on a limited range of subjects. But</line>
        <line>the pen is not for woman. Her power is too natural and immediate. It</line>
        <line>is with the living voice alone that she can compel the world to</line>
        <line>recognize the light of her intellect and the depth of her heart!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Now,--though I could not well say so to Zenobia,--I had not smiled from</line>
        <line>any unworthy estimate of woman, or in denial of the claims which she is</line>
        <line>beginning to put forth. What amused and puzzled me was the fact, that</line>
        <line>women, however intellectually superior, so seldom disquiet themselves</line>
        <line>about the rights or wrongs of their sex, unless their own individual</line>
        <line>affections chance to lie in idleness, or to be ill at ease. They are</line>
        <line>not natural reformers, but become such by the pressure of exceptional</line>
        <line>misfortune. I could measure Zenobia's inward trouble by the animosity</line>
        <line>with which she now took up the general quarrel of woman against man.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I will give you leave, Zenobia," replied I, "to fling your utmost</line>
        <line>scorn upon me, if you ever hear me utter a sentiment unfavorable to the</line>
        <line>widest liberty which woman has yet dreamed of. I would give her all</line>
        <line>she asks, and add a great deal more, which she will not be the party to</line>
        <line>demand, but which men, if they were generous and wise, would grant of</line>
        <line>their own free motion. For instance, I should love dearly--for the</line>
        <line>next thousand years, at least--to have all government devolve into the</line>
        <line>hands of women. I hate to be ruled by my own sex; it excites my</line>
        <line>jealousy, and wounds my pride. It is the iron sway of bodily force</line>
        <line>which abases us, in our compelled submission. But how sweet the free,</line>
        <line>generous courtesy with which I would kneel before a woman-ruler!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Yes, if she were young and beautiful," said Zenobia, laughing. "But</line>
        <line>how if she were sixty, and a fright?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah! it is you that rate womanhood low," said "But let me go on. I</line>
        <line>have never found it possible to suffer a bearded priest so near my</line>
        <line>heart and conscience as to do me any spiritual good. I blush at the</line>
        <line>very thought! Oh, in the better order of things, Heaven grant that the</line>
        <line>ministry of souls may be left in charge of women! The gates of the</line>
        <line>Blessed City will be thronged with the multitude that enter in, when</line>
        <line>that day comes! The task belongs to woman. God meant it for her. He</line>
        <line>has endowed her with the religious sentiment in its utmost depth and</line>
        <line>purity, refined from that gross, intellectual alloy with which every</line>
        <line>masculine theologist--save only One, who merely veiled himself in</line>
        <line>mortal and masculine shape, but was, in truth, divine--has been prone</line>
        <line>to mingle it. I have always envied the Catholics their faith in that</line>
        <line>sweet, sacred Virgin Mother, who stands between them and the Deity,</line>
        <line>intercepting somewhat of his awful splendor, but permitting his love to</line>
        <line>stream upon the worshipper more intelligibly to human comprehension</line>
        <line>through the medium of a woman's tenderness. Have I not said enough,</line>
        <line>Zenobia?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I cannot think that this is true," observed Priscilla, who had been</line>
        <line>gazing at me with great, disapproving eyes. "And I am sure I do not</line>
        <line>wish it to be true!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Poor child!" exclaimed Zenobia, rather contemptuously. "She is the</line>
        <line>type of womanhood, such as man has spent centuries in making it. He is</line>
        <line>never content unless he can degrade himself by stooping towards what he</line>
        <line>loves. In denying us our rights, he betrays even more blindness to his</line>
        <line>own interests than profligate disregard of ours!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Is this true?" asked Priscilla with simplicity, turning to</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth. "Is it all true, that Mr. Coverdale and Zenobia have</line>
        <line>been saying?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No, Priscilla!" answered Hollingsworth with his customary bluntness.</line>
        <line>"They have neither of them spoken one true word yet."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Do you despise woman?" said Zenobia.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, Hollingsworth, that would be most ungrateful!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Despise her? No!" cried Hollingsworth, lifting his great shaggy head</line>
        <line>and shaking it at us, while his eyes glowed almost fiercely. "She is</line>
        <line>the most admirable handiwork of God, in her true place and character.</line>
        <line>Her place is at man's side. Her office, that of the sympathizer; the</line>
        <line>unreserved, unquestioning believer; the recognition, withheld in every</line>
        <line>other manner, but given, in pity, through woman's heart, lest man</line>
        <line>should utterly lose faith in himself; the echo of God's own voice,</line>
        <line>pronouncing, 'It is well done!' All the separate action of woman is,</line>
        <line>and ever has been, and always shall be, false, foolish, vain,</line>
        <line>destructive of her own best and holiest qualities, void of every good</line>
        <line>effect, and productive of intolerable mischiefs! Man is a wretch</line>
        <line>without woman; but woman is a monster--and, thank Heaven, an almost</line>
        <line>impossible and hitherto imaginary monster--without man as her</line>
        <line>acknowledged principal! As true as I had once a mother whom I loved,</line>
        <line>were there any possible prospect of woman's taking the social stand</line>
        <line>which some of them,--poor, miserable, abortive creatures, who only</line>
        <line>dream of such things because they have missed woman's peculiar</line>
        <line>happiness, or because nature made them really neither man nor</line>
        <line>woman!--if there were a chance of their attaining the end which these</line>
        <line>petticoated monstrosities have in view, I would call upon my own sex to</line>
        <line>use its physical force, that unmistakable evidence of sovereignty, to</line>
        <line>scourge them back within their proper bounds! But it will not be</line>
        <line>needful. The heart of time womanhood knows where its own sphere is,</line>
        <line>and never seeks to stray beyond it!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Never was mortal blessed--if blessing it were--with a glance of such</line>
        <line>entire acquiescence and unquestioning faith, happy in its completeness,</line>
        <line>as our little Priscilla unconsciously bestowed on Hollingsworth. She</line>
        <line>seemed to take the sentiment from his lips into her heart, and brood</line>
        <line>over it in perfect content. The very woman whom he pictured--the</line>
        <line>gentle parasite, the soft reflection of a more powerful existence--sat</line>
        <line>there at his feet.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I looked at Zenobia, however, fully expecting her to resent--as I felt,</line>
        <line>by the indignant ebullition of my own blood, that she ought this</line>
        <line>outrageous affirmation of what struck me as the intensity of masculine</line>
        <line>egotism. It centred everything in itself, and deprived woman of her</line>
        <line>very soul, her inexpressible and unfathomable all, to make it a mere</line>
        <line>incident in the great sum of man. Hollingsworth had boldly uttered</line>
        <line>what he, and millions of despots like him, really felt. Without</line>
        <line>intending it, he had disclosed the wellspring of all these troubled</line>
        <line>waters. Now, if ever, it surely behooved Zenobia to be the champion of</line>
        <line>her sex.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But, to my surprise, and indignation too, she only looked humbled. Some</line>
        <line>tears sparkled in her eyes, but they were wholly of grief, not anger.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, be it so," was all she said. "I, at least, have deep cause to</line>
        <line>think you right. Let man be but manly and godlike, and woman is only</line>
        <line>too ready to become to him what you say!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I smiled--somewhat bitterly, it is true--in contemplation of my own</line>
        <line>ill-luck. How little did these two women care for me, who had freely</line>
        <line>conceded all their claims, and a great deal more, out of the fulness of</line>
        <line>my heart; while Hollingsworth, by some necromancy of his horrible</line>
        <line>injustice, seemed to have brought them both to his feet!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Women almost invariably behave thus," thought "What does the fact</line>
        <line>mean? Is it their nature? Or is it, at last, the result of ages of</line>
        <line>compelled degradation? And, in either case, will it be possible ever</line>
        <line>to redeem them?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>An intuition now appeared to possess all the party, that, for this</line>
        <line>time, at least, there was no more to be said. With one accord, we</line>
        <line>arose from the ground, and made our way through the tangled undergrowth</line>
        <line>towards one of those pleasant wood-paths that wound among the</line>
        <line>overarching trees. Some of the branches hung so low as partly to</line>
        <line>conceal the figures that went before from those who followed. Priscilla</line>
        <line>had leaped up more lightly than the rest of us, and ran along in</line>
        <line>advance, with as much airy activity of spirit as was typified in the</line>
        <line>motion of a bird, which chanced to be flitting from tree to tree, in</line>
        <line>the same direction as herself. Never did she seem so happy as that</line>
        <line>afternoon. She skipt, and could not help it, from very playfulness of</line>
        <line>heart.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia and Hollingsworth went next, in close contiguity, but not with</line>
        <line>arm in arm. Now, just when they had passed the impending bough of a</line>
        <line>birch-tree, I plainly saw Zenobia take the hand of Hollingsworth in</line>
        <line>both her own, press it to her bosom, and let it fall again!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The gesture was sudden, and full of passion; the impulse had evidently</line>
        <line>taken her by surprise; it expressed all! Had Zenobia knelt before him,</line>
        <line>or flung herself upon his breast, and gasped out, "I love you,</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth!" I could not have been more certain of what it meant.</line>
        <line>They then walked onward, as before. But, methought, as the declining</line>
        <line>sun threw Zenobia's magnified shadow along the path, I beheld it</line>
        <line>tremulous; and the delicate stem of the flower which she wore in her</line>
        <line>hair was likewise responsive to her agitation.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Priscilla--through the medium of her eyes, at least could not possibly</line>
        <line>have been aware of the gesture above described. Yet, at that instant,</line>
        <line>I saw her droop. The buoyancy, which just before had been so</line>
        <line>bird-like, was utterly departed; the life seemed to pass out of her,</line>
        <line>and even the substance of her figure to grow thin and gray. I almost</line>
        <line>imagined her a shadow, tiding gradually into the dimness of the wood.</line>
        <line>Her pace became so slow that Hollingsworth and Zenobia passed by, and</line>
        <line>I, without hastening my footsteps, overtook her.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Come, Priscilla," said I, looking her intently in the face, which was</line>
        <line>very pale and sorrowful, "we must make haste after our friends. Do you</line>
        <line>feel suddenly ill? A moment ago, you flitted along so lightly that I</line>
        <line>was comparing you to a bird. Now, on the contrary, it is as if you had</line>
        <line>a heavy heart, and a very little strength to bear it with. Pray take my</line>
        <line>arm!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No," said Priscilla, "I do not think it would help me. It is my</line>
        <line>heart, as you say, that makes me heavy; and I know not why. Just now,</line>
        <line>I felt very happy."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>No doubt it was a kind of sacrilege in me to attempt to come within her</line>
        <line>maidenly mystery; but, as she appeared to be tossed aside by her other</line>
        <line>friends, or carelessly let fall, like a flower which they had done</line>
        <line>with, I could not resist the impulse to take just one peep beneath her</line>
        <line>folded petals.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Zenobia and yourself are dear friends of late," I remarked. "At</line>
        <line>first,--that first evening when you came to us,--she did not receive</line>
        <line>you quite so warmly as might have been wished."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I remember it," said Priscilla. "No wonder she hesitated to love me,</line>
        <line>who was then a stranger to her, and a girl of no grace or beauty,--she</line>
        <line>being herself so beautiful!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"But she loves you now, of course?" suggested "And at this very</line>
        <line>instant you feel her to be your dearest friend?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Why do you ask me that question?" exclaimed Priscilla, as if</line>
        <line>frightened at the scrutiny into her feelings which I compelled her to</line>
        <line>make. "It somehow puts strange thoughts into my mind. But I do love</line>
        <line>Zenobia dearly! If she only loves me half as well, I shall be happy!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"How is it possible to doubt that, Priscilla?" I rejoined. "But</line>
        <line>observe how pleasantly and happily Zenobia and Hollingsworth are</line>
        <line>walking together. I call it a delightful spectacle. It truly rejoices</line>
        <line>me that Hollingsworth has found so fit and affectionate a friend! So</line>
        <line>many people in the world mistrust him,--so many disbelieve and</line>
        <line>ridicule, while hardly any do him justice, or acknowledge him for the</line>
        <line>wonderful man he is,--that it is really a blessed thing for him to have</line>
        <line>won the sympathy of such a woman as Zenobia. Any man might be proud of</line>
        <line>that. Any man, even if he be as great as Hollingsworth, might love so</line>
        <line>magnificent a woman. How very beautiful Zenobia is! And Hollingsworth</line>
        <line>knows it, too."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There may have been some petty malice in what I said. Generosity is a</line>
        <line>very fine thing, at a proper time and within due limits. But it is an</line>
        <line>insufferable bore to see one man engrossing every thought of all the</line>
        <line>women, and leaving his friend to shiver in outer seclusion, without</line>
        <line>even the alternative of solacing himself with what the more fortunate</line>
        <line>individual has rejected. Yes, it was out of a foolish bitterness of</line>
        <line>heart that I had spoken.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Go on before," said Priscilla abruptly, and with true feminine</line>
        <line>imperiousness, which heretofore I had never seen her exercise. "It</line>
        <line>pleases me best to loiter along by myself. I do not walk so fast as</line>
        <line>you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>With her hand she made a little gesture of dismissal. It provoked me;</line>
        <line>yet, on the whole, was the most bewitching thing that Priscilla had</line>
        <line>ever done. I obeyed her, and strolled moodily homeward, wondering--as</line>
        <line>I had wondered a thousand times already--how Hollingsworth meant to</line>
        <line>dispose of these two hearts, which (plainly to my perception, and, as I</line>
        <line>could not but now suppose, to his) he had engrossed into his own huge</line>
        <line>egotism.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There was likewise another subject hardly less fruitful of speculation.</line>
        <line>In what attitude did Zenobia present herself to Hollingsworth? Was it</line>
        <line>in that of a free woman, with no mortgage on her affections nor</line>
        <line>claimant to her hand, but fully at liberty to surrender both, in</line>
        <line>exchange for the heart and hand which she apparently expected to</line>
        <line>receive? But was it a vision that I had witnessed in the wood? Was</line>
        <line>Westervelt a goblin? Were those words of passion and agony, which</line>
        <line>Zenobia had uttered in my hearing, a mere stage declamation? Were they</line>
        <line>formed of a material lighter than common air? Or, supposing them to</line>
        <line>bear sterling weight, was it a perilous and dreadful wrong which she</line>
        <line>was meditating towards herself and Hollingsworth?</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Arriving nearly at the farmhouse, I looked back over the long slope of</line>
        <line>pasture land, and beheld them standing together, in the light of</line>
        <line>sunset, just on the spot where, according to the gossip of the</line>
        <line>Community, they meant to build their cottage. Priscilla, alone and</line>
        <line>forgotten, was lingering in the shadow of the wood.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>A CRISIS</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Thus the summer was passing away,--a summer of toil, of interest, of</line>
        <line>something that was not pleasure, but which went deep into my heart, and</line>
        <line>there became a rich experience. I found myself looking forward to</line>
        <line>years, if not to a lifetime, to be spent on the same system. The</line>
        <line>Community were now beginning to form their permanent plans. One of our</line>
        <line>purposes was to erect a Phalanstery (as I think we called it, after</line>
        <line>Fourier; but the phraseology of those days is not very fresh in my</line>
        <line>remembrance), where the great and general family should have its</line>
        <line>abiding-place. Individual members, too, who made it a point of</line>
        <line>religion to preserve the sanctity of an exclusive home, were selecting</line>
        <line>sites for their cottages, by the wood-side, or on the breezy swells, or</line>
        <line>in the sheltered nook of some little valley, according as their taste</line>
        <line>might lean towards snugness or the picturesque. Altogether, by</line>
        <line>projecting our minds outward, we had imparted a show of novelty to</line>
        <line>existence, and contemplated it as hopefully as if the soil beneath our</line>
        <line>feet had not been fathom-deep with the dust of deluded generations, on</line>
        <line>every one of which, as on ourselves, the world had imposed itself as a</line>
        <line>hitherto unwedded bride.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hollingsworth and myself had often discussed these prospects. It was</line>
        <line>easy to perceive, however, that he spoke with little or no fervor, but</line>
        <line>either as questioning the fulfilment of our anticipations, or, at any</line>
        <line>rate, with a quiet consciousness that it was no personal concern of</line>
        <line>his. Shortly after the scene at Eliot's pulpit, while he and I were</line>
        <line>repairing an old stone fence, I amused myself with sallying forward</line>
        <line>into the future time.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"When we come to be old men," I said, "they will call us uncles, or</line>
        <line>fathers,--Father Hollingsworth and Uncle Coverdale,--and we will look</line>
        <line>back cheerfully to these early days, and make a romantic story for the</line>
        <line>young People (and if a little more romantic than truth may warrant, it</line>
        <line>will be no harm) out of our severe trials and hardships. In a century</line>
        <line>or two, we shall, every one of us, be mythical personages, or</line>
        <line>exceedingly picturesque and poetical ones, at all events. They will</line>
        <line>have a great public hall, in which your portrait, and mine, and twenty</line>
        <line>other faces that are living now, shall be hung up; and as for me, I</line>
        <line>will be painted in my shirtsleeves, and with the sleeves rolled up, to</line>
        <line>show my muscular development. What stories will be rife among them</line>
        <line>about our mighty strength!" continued I, lifting a big stone and</line>
        <line>putting it into its place, "though our posterity will really be far</line>
        <line>stronger than ourselves, after several generations of a simple,</line>
        <line>natural, and active life. What legends of Zenobia's beauty, and</line>
        <line>Priscilla's slender and shadowy grace, and those mysterious qualities</line>
        <line>which make her seem diaphanous with spiritual light! In due course of</line>
        <line>ages, we must all figure heroically in an epic poem; and we will</line>
        <line>ourselves--at least, I will--bend unseen over the future poet, and lend</line>
        <line>him inspiration while he writes it."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You seem," said Hollingsworth, "to be trying how much nonsense you can</line>
        <line>pour out in a breath."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I wish you would see fit to comprehend," retorted I, "that the</line>
        <line>profoundest wisdom must be mingled with nine tenths of nonsense, else</line>
        <line>it is not worth the breath that utters it. But I do long for the</line>
        <line>cottages to be built, that the creeping plants may begin to run over</line>
        <line>them, and the moss to gather on the walls, and the trees--which we will</line>
        <line>set out--to cover them with a breadth of shadow. This spick-and-span</line>
        <line>novelty does not quite suit my taste. It is time, too, for children to</line>
        <line>be born among us. The first-born child is still to come. And I shall</line>
        <line>never feel as if this were a real, practical, as well as poetical</line>
        <line>system of human life, until somebody has sanctified it by death."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"A pretty occasion for martyrdom, truly!" said Hollingsworth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"As good as any other," I replied. "I wonder, Hollingsworth, who, of</line>
        <line>all these strong men, and fair women and maidens, is doomed the first</line>
        <line>to die. Would it not be well, even before we have absolute need of it,</line>
        <line>to fix upon a spot for a cemetery? Let us choose the rudest, roughest,</line>
        <line>most uncultivable spot, for Death's garden ground; and Death shall</line>
        <line>teach us to beautify it, grave by grave. By our sweet, calm way of</line>
        <line>dying, and the airy elegance out of which we will shape our funeral</line>
        <line>rites, and the cheerful allegories which we will model into tombstones,</line>
        <line>the final scene shall lose its terrors; so that hereafter it may be</line>
        <line>happiness to live, and bliss to die. None of us must die young. Yet,</line>
        <line>should Providence ordain it so, the event shall not be sorrowful, but</line>
        <line>affect us with a tender, delicious, only half-melancholy, and almost</line>
        <line>smiling pathos!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"That is to say," muttered Hollingsworth, "you will die like a heathen,</line>
        <line>as you certainly live like one. But, listen to me, Coverdale. Your</line>
        <line>fantastic anticipations make me discern all the more forcibly what a</line>
        <line>wretched, unsubstantial scheme is this, on which we have wasted a</line>
        <line>precious summer of our lives. Do you seriously imagine that any such</line>
        <line>realities as you, and many others here, have dreamed of, will ever be</line>
        <line>brought to pass?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Certainly I do," said "Of course, when the reality comes, it will</line>
        <line>wear the every-day, commonplace, dusty, and rather homely garb that</line>
        <line>reality always does put on. But, setting aside the ideal charm, I hold</line>
        <line>that our highest anticipations have a solid footing on common sense."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You only half believe what you say," rejoined Hollingsworth; "and as</line>
        <line>for me, I neither have faith in your dream, nor would care the value of</line>
        <line>this pebble for its realization, were that possible. And what more do</line>
        <line>you want of it? It has given you a theme for poetry. Let that content</line>
        <line>you. But now I ask you to be, at last, a man of sobriety and</line>
        <line>earnestness, and aid me in an enterprise which is worth all our</line>
        <line>strength, and the strength of a thousand mightier than we."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There can be no need of giving in detail the conversation that ensued.</line>
        <line>It is enough to say that Hollingsworth once more brought forward his</line>
        <line>rigid and unconquerable idea,--a scheme for the reformation of the</line>
        <line>wicked by methods moral, intellectual, and industrial, by the sympathy</line>
        <line>of pure, humble, and yet exalted minds, and by opening to his pupils</line>
        <line>the possibility of a worthier life than that which had become their</line>
        <line>fate. It appeared, unless he overestimated his own means, that</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth held it at his choice (and he did so choose) to obtain</line>
        <line>possession of the very ground on which we had planted our Community,</line>
        <line>and which had not yet been made irrevocably ours, by purchase. It was</line>
        <line>just the foundation that he desired. Our beginnings might readily be</line>
        <line>adapted to his great end. The arrangements already completed would</line>
        <line>work quietly into his system. So plausible looked his theory, and, more</line>
        <line>than that, so practical,--such an air of reasonableness had he, by</line>
        <line>patient thought, thrown over it,--each segment of it was contrived to</line>
        <line>dovetail into all the rest with such a complicated applicability, and</line>
        <line>so ready was he with a response for every objection, that, really, so</line>
        <line>far as logic and argument went, he had the matter all his own way.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"But," said I, "whence can you, having no means of your own, derive the</line>
        <line>enormous capital which is essential to this experiment? State Street,</line>
        <line>I imagine, would not draw its purser strings very liberally in aid of</line>
        <line>such a speculation."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I have the funds--as much, at least, as is needed for a</line>
        <line>commencement--at command," he answered. "They can be produced within a</line>
        <line>month, if necessary."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>My thoughts reverted to Zenobia. It could only be her wealth which</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth was appropriating so lavishly. And on what conditions</line>
        <line>was it to be had? Did she fling it into the scheme with the</line>
        <line>uncalculating generosity that characterizes a woman when it is her</line>
        <line>impulse to be generous at all? And did she fling herself along with</line>
        <line>it? But Hollingsworth did not volunteer an explanation.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And have you no regrets," I inquired, "in overthrowing this fair</line>
        <line>system of our new life, which has been planned so deeply, and is now</line>
        <line>beginning to flourish so hopefully around us? How beautiful it is,</line>
        <line>and, so far as we can yet see, how practicable! The ages have waited</line>
        <line>for us, and here we are, the very first that have essayed to carry on</line>
        <line>our mortal existence in love and mutual help! Hollingsworth, I would</line>
        <line>be loath to take the ruin of this enterprise upon my conscience."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Then let it rest wholly upon mine!" he answered, knitting his black</line>
        <line>brows. "I see through the system. It is full of</line>
        <line>defects,--irremediable and damning ones!--from first to last, there is</line>
        <line>nothing else! I grasp it in my hand, and find no substance whatever.</line>
        <line>There is not human nature in it."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Why are you so secret in your operations?" I asked. "God forbid that</line>
        <line>I should accuse you of intentional wrong; but the besetting sin of a</line>
        <line>philanthropist, it appears to me, is apt to be a moral obliquity. His</line>
        <line>sense of honor ceases to be the sense of other honorable men. At some</line>
        <line>point of his course--I know not exactly when or where--he is tempted to</line>
        <line>palter with the right, and can scarcely forbear persuading himself that</line>
        <line>the importance of his public ends renders it allowable to throw aside</line>
        <line>his private conscience. Oh, my dear friend, beware this error! If you</line>
        <line>meditate the overthrow of this establishment, call together our</line>
        <line>companions, state your design, support it with all your eloquence, but</line>
        <line>allow them an opportunity of defending themselves."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It does not suit me," said Hollingsworth. "Nor is it my duty to do</line>
        <line>so."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I think it is," replied I.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hollingsworth frowned; not in passion, but, like fate, inexorably.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I will not argue the point," said he. "What I desire to know of you</line>
        <line>is,--and you can tell me in one word,--whether I am to look for your</line>
        <line>cooperation in this great scheme of good? Take it up with me! Be my</line>
        <line>brother in it! It offers you (what you have told me, over and over</line>
        <line>again, that you most need) a purpose in life, worthy of the extremest</line>
        <line>self-devotion,--worthy of martyrdom, should God so order it! In this</line>
        <line>view, I present it to you. You can greatly benefit mankind. Your</line>
        <line>peculiar faculties, as I shall direct them, are capable of being so</line>
        <line>wrought into this enterprise that not one of them need lie idle. Strike</line>
        <line>hands with me, and from this moment you shall never again feel the</line>
        <line>languor and vague wretchedness of an indolent or half-occupied man.</line>
        <line>There may be no more aimless beauty in your life; but, in its stead,</line>
        <line>there shall be strength, courage, immitigable will,--everything that a</line>
        <line>manly and generous nature should desire! We shall succeed! We shall</line>
        <line>have done our best for this miserable world; and happiness (which never</line>
        <line>comes but incidentally) will come to us unawares."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It seemed his intention to say no more. But, after he had quite broken</line>
        <line>off, his deep eyes filled with tears, and he held out both his hands to</line>
        <line>me.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Coverdale," he murmured, "there is not the man in this wide world whom</line>
        <line>I can love as I could you. Do not forsake me!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As I look back upon this scene, through the coldness and dimness of so</line>
        <line>many years, there is still a sensation as if Hollingsworth had caught</line>
        <line>hold of my heart, and were pulling it towards him with an almost</line>
        <line>irresistible force. It is a mystery to me how I withstood it. But, in</line>
        <line>truth, I saw in his scheme of philanthropy nothing but what was odious.</line>
        <line>A loathsomeness that was to be forever in my daily work! A great black</line>
        <line>ugliness of sin, which he proposed to collect out of a thousand human</line>
        <line>hearts, and that we should spend our lives in an experiment of</line>
        <line>transmuting it into virtue! Had I but touched his extended hand,</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's magnetism would perhaps have penetrated me with his own</line>
        <line>conception of all these matters. But I stood aloof. I fortified</line>
        <line>myself with doubts whether his strength of purpose had not been too</line>
        <line>gigantic for his integrity, impelling him to trample on considerations</line>
        <line>that should have been paramount to every other.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Is Zenobia to take a part in your enterprise?" I asked.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"She is," said Hollingsworth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"She!--the beautiful!--the gorgeous!" I exclaimed. "And how have you</line>
        <line>prevailed with such a woman to work in this squalid element?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Through no base methods, as you seem to suspect," he answered; "but by</line>
        <line>addressing whatever is best and noblest in her."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hollingsworth was looking on the ground. But, as he often did</line>
        <line>so,--generally, indeed, in his habitual moods of thought,--I could not</line>
        <line>judge whether it was from any special unwillingness now to meet my</line>
        <line>eyes. What it was that dictated my next question, I cannot precisely</line>
        <line>say. Nevertheless, it rose so inevitably into my mouth, and, as it</line>
        <line>were, asked itself so involuntarily, that there must needs have been an</line>
        <line>aptness in it.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What is to become of Priscilla?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hollingsworth looked at me fiercely, and with glowing eyes. He could</line>
        <line>not have shown any other kind of expression than that, had he meant to</line>
        <line>strike me with a sword.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Why do you bring in the names of these women?" said he, after a moment</line>
        <line>of pregnant silence. "What have they to do with the proposal which I</line>
        <line>make you? I must have your answer! Will you devote yourself, and</line>
        <line>sacrifice all to this great end, and be my friend of friends forever?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"In Heaven's name, Hollingsworth," cried I, getting angry, and glad to</line>
        <line>be angry, because so only was it possible to oppose his tremendous</line>
        <line>concentrativeness and indomitable will, "cannot you conceive that a man</line>
        <line>may wish well to the world, and struggle for its good, on some other</line>
        <line>plan than precisely that which you have laid down? And will you cast</line>
        <line>off a friend for no unworthiness, but merely because he stands upon his</line>
        <line>right as an individual being, and looks at matters through his own</line>
        <line>optics, instead of yours?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Be with me," said Hollingsworth, "or be against me! There is no third</line>
        <line>choice for you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Take this, then, as my decision," I answered. "I doubt the wisdom of</line>
        <line>your scheme. Furthermore, I greatly fear that the methods by which you</line>
        <line>allow yourself to pursue it are such as cannot stand the scrutiny of an</line>
        <line>unbiassed conscience."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And you will not join me?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I never said the word--and certainly can never have it to say</line>
        <line>hereafter--that cost me a thousandth part so hard an effort as did that</line>
        <line>one syllable. The heart-pang was not merely figurative, but an</line>
        <line>absolute torture of the breast. I was gazing steadfastly at</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth. It seemed to me that it struck him, too, like a bullet.</line>
        <line>A ghastly paleness--always so terrific on a swarthy face--overspread</line>
        <line>his features. There was a convulsive movement of his throat, as if he</line>
        <line>were forcing down some words that struggled and fought for utterance.</line>
        <line>Whether words of anger, or words of grief, I cannot tell; although many</line>
        <line>and many a time I have vainly tormented myself with conjecturing which</line>
        <line>of the two they were. One other appeal to my friendship,--such as</line>
        <line>once, already, Hollingsworth had made,--taking me in the revulsion that</line>
        <line>followed a strenuous exercise of opposing will, would completely have</line>
        <line>subdued me. But he left the matter there. "Well!" said he.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And that was all! I should have been thankful for one word more, even</line>
        <line>had it shot me through the heart, as mine did him. But he did not</line>
        <line>speak it; and, after a few moments, with one accord, we set to work</line>
        <line>again, repairing the stone fence. Hollingsworth, I observed, wrought</line>
        <line>like a Titan; and, for my own part, I lifted stones which at this</line>
        <line>day--or, in a calmer mood, at that one--I should no more have thought</line>
        <line>it possible to stir than to carry off the gates of Gaza on my back.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>LEAVE-TAKINGS</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>A few days after the tragic passage-at-arms between Hollingsworth and</line>
        <line>me, I appeared at the dinner-table actually dressed in a coat, instead</line>
        <line>of my customary blouse; with a satin cravat, too, a white vest, and</line>
        <line>several other things that made me seem strange and outlandish to</line>
        <line>myself. As for my companions, this unwonted spectacle caused a great</line>
        <line>stir upon the wooden benches that bordered either side of our homely</line>
        <line>board.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What's in the wind now, Miles?" asked one of them. "Are you deserting</line>
        <line>us?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Yes, for a week or two," said "It strikes me that my health demands</line>
        <line>a little relaxation of labor, and a short visit to the seaside, during</line>
        <line>the dog-days."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You look like it!" grumbled Silas Foster, not greatly pleased with the</line>
        <line>idea of losing an efficient laborer before the stress of the season was</line>
        <line>well over. "Now, here's a pretty fellow! His shoulders have broadened</line>
        <line>a matter of six inches since he came among us; he can do his day's</line>
        <line>work, if he likes, with any man or ox on the farm; and yet he talks</line>
        <line>about going to the seashore for his health! Well, well, old woman,"</line>
        <line>added he to his wife, "let me have a plateful of that pork and cabbage!</line>
        <line>I begin to feel in a very weakly way. When the others have had their</line>
        <line>turn, you and I will take a jaunt to Newport or Saratoga!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, but, Mr. Foster," said I, "you must allow me to take a little</line>
        <line>breath."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Breath!" retorted the old yeoman. "Your lungs have the play of a pair</line>
        <line>of blacksmith's bellows already. What on earth do you want more? But</line>
        <line>go along! I understand the business. We shall never see your face</line>
        <line>here again. Here ends the reformation of the world, so far as Miles</line>
        <line>Coverdale has a hand in it!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"By no means," I replied. "I am resolute to die in the last ditch, for</line>
        <line>the good of the cause."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Die in a ditch!" muttered gruff Silas, with genuine Yankee intolerance</line>
        <line>of any intermission of toil, except on Sunday, the Fourth of July, the</line>
        <line>autumnal cattle-show, Thanksgiving, or the annual Fast,--"die in a</line>
        <line>ditch! I believe, in my conscience, you would, if there were no</line>
        <line>steadier means than your own labor to keep you out of it!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The truth was, that an intolerable discontent and irksomeness had come</line>
        <line>over me. Blithedale was no longer what it had been. Everything was</line>
        <line>suddenly faded. The sunburnt and arid aspect of our woods and</line>
        <line>pastures, beneath the August sky, did but imperfectly symbolize the</line>
        <line>lack of dew and moisture, that, since yesterday, as it were, had</line>
        <line>blighted my fields of thought, and penetrated to the innermost and</line>
        <line>shadiest of my contemplative recesses. The change will be recognized</line>
        <line>by many, who, after a period of happiness, have endeavored to go on</line>
        <line>with the same kind of life, in the same scene, in spite of the</line>
        <line>alteration or withdrawal of some principal circumstance. They discover</line>
        <line>(what heretofore, perhaps, they had not known) that it was this which</line>
        <line>gave the bright color and vivid reality to the whole affair.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I stood on other terms than before, not only with Hollingsworth, but</line>
        <line>with Zenobia and Priscilla. As regarded the two latter, it was that</line>
        <line>dreamlike and miserable sort of change that denies you the privilege to</line>
        <line>complain, because you can assert no positive injury, nor lay your</line>
        <line>finger on anything tangible. It is a matter which you do not see, but</line>
        <line>feel, and which, when you try to analyze it, seems to lose its very</line>
        <line>existence, and resolve itself into a sickly humor of your own. Your</line>
        <line>understanding, possibly, may put faith in this denial. But your heart</line>
        <line>will not so easily rest satisfied. It incessantly remonstrates,</line>
        <line>though, most of the time, in a bass-note, which you do not separately</line>
        <line>distinguish; but, now and then, with a sharp cry, importunate to be</line>
        <line>heard, and resolute to claim belief. "Things are not as they were!" it</line>
        <line>keeps saying. "You shall not impose on me! I will never be quiet! I</line>
        <line>will throb painfully! I will be heavy, and desolate, and shiver with</line>
        <line>cold! For I, your deep heart, know when to be miserable, as once I</line>
        <line>knew when to be happy! All is changed for us! You are beloved no</line>
        <line>more!" And were my life to be spent over again, I would invariably</line>
        <line>lend my ear to this Cassandra of the inward depths, however clamorous</line>
        <line>the music and the merriment of a more superficial region.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>My outbreak with Hollingsworth, though never definitely known to our</line>
        <line>associates, had really an effect upon the moral atmosphere of the</line>
        <line>Community. It was incidental to the closeness of relationship into</line>
        <line>which we had brought ourselves, that an unfriendly state of feeling</line>
        <line>could not occur between any two members without the whole society being</line>
        <line>more or less commoted and made uncomfortable thereby. This species of</line>
        <line>nervous sympathy (though a pretty characteristic enough, sentimentally</line>
        <line>considered, and apparently betokening an actual bond of love among us)</line>
        <line>was yet found rather inconvenient in its practical operation, mortal</line>
        <line>tempers being so infirm and variable as they are. If one of us happened</line>
        <line>to give his neighbor a box on the ear, the tingle was immediately felt</line>
        <line>on the same side of everybody's head. Thus, even on the supposition</line>
        <line>that we were far less quarrelsome than the rest of the world, a great</line>
        <line>deal of time was necessarily wasted in rubbing our ears.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Musing on all these matters, I felt an inexpressible longing for at</line>
        <line>least a temporary novelty. I thought of going across the Rocky</line>
        <line>Mountains, or to Europe, or up the Nile; of offering myself a volunteer</line>
        <line>on the Exploring Expedition; of taking a ramble of years, no matter in</line>
        <line>what direction, and coming back on the other side of the world. Then,</line>
        <line>should the colonists of Blithedale have established their enterprise on</line>
        <line>a permanent basis, I might fling aside my pilgrim staff and dusty</line>
        <line>shoon, and rest as peacefully here as elsewhere. Or, in case</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth should occupy the ground with his School of Reform, as he</line>
        <line>now purposed, I might plead earthly guilt enough, by that time, to give</line>
        <line>me what I was inclined to think the only trustworthy hold on his</line>
        <line>affections. Meanwhile, before deciding on any ultimate plan, I</line>
        <line>determined to remove myself to a little distance, and take an exterior</line>
        <line>view of what we had all been about.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>In truth, it was dizzy work, amid such fermentation of opinions as was</line>
        <line>going on in the general brain of the Community. It was a kind of</line>
        <line>Bedlam, for the time being, although out of the very thoughts that were</line>
        <line>wildest and most destructive might grow a wisdom, holy, calm, and pure,</line>
        <line>and that should incarnate itself with the substance of a noble and</line>
        <line>happy life. But, as matters now were, I felt myself (and, having a</line>
        <line>decided tendency towards the actual, I never liked to feel it) getting</line>
        <line>quite out of my reckoning, with regard to the existing state of the</line>
        <line>world. I was beginning to lose the sense of what kind of a world it</line>
        <line>was, among innumerable schemes of what it might or ought to be. It was</line>
        <line>impossible, situated as we were, not to imbibe the idea that everything</line>
        <line>in nature and human existence was fluid, or fast becoming so; that the</line>
        <line>crust of the earth in many places was broken, and its whole surface</line>
        <line>portentously upheaving; that it was a day of crisis, and that we</line>
        <line>ourselves were in the critical vortex. Our great globe floated in the</line>
        <line>atmosphere of infinite space like an unsubstantial bubble. No</line>
        <line>sagacious man will long retain his sagacity, if he live exclusively</line>
        <line>among reformers and progressive people, without periodically returning</line>
        <line>into the settled system of things, to correct himself by a new</line>
        <line>observation from that old standpoint.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It was now time for me, therefore, to go and hold a little talk with</line>
        <line>the conservatives, the writers of "The North American Review," the</line>
        <line>merchants, the politicians, the Cambridge men, and all those</line>
        <line>respectable old blockheads who still, in this intangibility and</line>
        <line>mistiness of affairs, kept a death-grip on one or two ideas which had</line>
        <line>not come into vogue since yesterday morning.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The brethren took leave of me with cordial kindness; and as for the</line>
        <line>sisterhood, I had serious thoughts of kissing them all round, but</line>
        <line>forbore to do so, because, in all such general salutations, the penance</line>
        <line>is fully equal to the pleasure. So I kissed none of them; and nobody,</line>
        <line>to say the truth, seemed to expect it.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Do you wish me," I said to Zenobia, "to announce in town, and at the</line>
        <line>watering-places, your purpose to deliver a course of lectures on the</line>
        <line>rights of women?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Women possess no rights," said Zenobia, with a half-melancholy smile;</line>
        <line>"or, at all events, only little girls and grandmothers would have the</line>
        <line>force to exercise them."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She gave me her hand freely and kindly, and looked at me, I thought,</line>
        <line>with a pitying expression in her eyes; nor was there any settled light</line>
        <line>of joy in them on her own behalf, but a troubled and passionate flame,</line>
        <line>flickering and fitful.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I regret, on the whole, that you are leaving us," she said; "and all</line>
        <line>the more, since I feel that this phase of our life is finished, and can</line>
        <line>never be lived over again. Do you know, Mr. Coverdale, that I have</line>
        <line>been several times on the point of making you my confidant, for lack of</line>
        <line>a better and wiser one? But you are too young to be my father</line>
        <line>confessor; and you would not thank me for treating you like one of</line>
        <line>those good little handmaidens who share the bosom secrets of a</line>
        <line>tragedy-queen."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I would, at least, be loyal and faithful," answered I; "and would</line>
        <line>counsel you with an honest purpose, if not wisely."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Yes," said Zenobia, "you would be only too wise, too honest. Honesty</line>
        <line>and wisdom are such a delightful pastime, at another person's expense!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, Zenobia," I exclaimed, "if you would but let me speak!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"By no means," she replied, "especially when you have just resumed the</line>
        <line>whole series of social conventionalisms, together with that</line>
        <line>strait-bodied coat. I would as lief open my heart to a lawyer or a</line>
        <line>clergyman! No, no, Mr. Coverdale; if I choose a counsellor, in the</line>
        <line>present aspect of my affairs, it must be either an angel or a madman;</line>
        <line>and I rather apprehend that the latter would be likeliest of the two to</line>
        <line>speak the fitting word. It needs a wild steersman when we voyage</line>
        <line>through chaos! The anchor is up,--farewell!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Priscilla, as soon as dinner was over, had betaken herself into a</line>
        <line>corner, and set to work on a little purse. As I approached her, she</line>
        <line>let her eyes rest on me with a calm, serious look; for, with all her</line>
        <line>delicacy of nerves, there was a singular self-possession in Priscilla,</line>
        <line>and her sensibilities seemed to lie sheltered from ordinary commotion,</line>
        <line>like the water in a deep well.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Will you give me that purse, Priscilla," said I, "as a parting</line>
        <line>keepsake?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Yes," she answered, "if you will wait till it is finished."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I must not wait, even for that," I replied. "Shall I find you here,</line>
        <line>on my return?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I never wish to go away," said she.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I have sometimes thought," observed I, smiling, "that you, Priscilla,</line>
        <line>are a little prophetess, or, at least, that you have spiritual</line>
        <line>intimations respecting matters which are dark to us grosser people. If</line>
        <line>that be the case, I should like to ask you what is about to happen; for</line>
        <line>I am tormented with a strong foreboding that, were I to return even so</line>
        <line>soon as to-morrow morning, I should find everything changed. Have you</line>
        <line>any impressions of this nature?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, no," said Priscilla, looking at me apprehensively. "If any such</line>
        <line>misfortune is coming, the shadow has not reached me yet. Heaven</line>
        <line>forbid! I should be glad if there might never be any change, but one</line>
        <line>summer follow another, and all just like this."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No summer ever came back, and no two summers ever were alike," said I,</line>
        <line>with a degree of Orphic wisdom that astonished myself. "Times change,</line>
        <line>and people change; and if our hearts do not change as readily, so much</line>
        <line>the worse for us. Good-by, Priscilla!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I gave her hand a pressure, which, I think, she neither resisted nor</line>
        <line>returned. Priscilla's heart was deep, but of small compass; it had</line>
        <line>room but for a very few dearest ones, among whom she never reckoned me.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>On the doorstep I met Hollingsworth. I had a momentary impulse to hold</line>
        <line>out my hand, or at least to give a parting nod, but resisted both.</line>
        <line>When a real and strong affection has come to an end, it is not well to</line>
        <line>mock the sacred past with any show of those commonplace civilities that</line>
        <line>belong to ordinary intercourse. Being dead henceforth to him, and he</line>
        <line>to me, there could be no propriety in our chilling one another with the</line>
        <line>touch of two corpse-like hands, or playing at looks of courtesy with</line>
        <line>eyes that were impenetrable beneath the glaze and the film. We passed,</line>
        <line>therefore, as if mutually invisible.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I can nowise explain what sort of whim, prank, or perversity it was,</line>
        <line>that, after all these leave-takings, induced me to go to the pigsty,</line>
        <line>and take leave of the swine! There they lay, buried as deeply among</line>
        <line>the straw as they could burrow, four huge black grunters, the very</line>
        <line>symbols of slothful ease and sensual comfort. They were asleep,</line>
        <line>drawing short and heavy breaths, which heaved their big sides up and</line>
        <line>down. Unclosing their eyes, however, at my approach, they looked dimly</line>
        <line>forth at the outer world, and simultaneously uttered a gentle grunt;</line>
        <line>not putting themselves to the trouble of an additional breath for that</line>
        <line>particular purpose, but grunting with their ordinary inhalation. They</line>
        <line>were involved, and almost stifled and buried alive, in their own</line>
        <line>corporeal substance. The very unreadiness and oppression wherewith</line>
        <line>these greasy citizens gained breath enough to keep their life-machinery</line>
        <line>in sluggish movement appeared to make them only the more sensible of</line>
        <line>the ponderous and fat satisfaction of their existence. Peeping at me</line>
        <line>an instant out of their small, red, hardly perceptible eyes, they dropt</line>
        <line>asleep again; yet not so far asleep but that their unctuous bliss was</line>
        <line>still present to them, betwixt dream and reality.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You must come back in season to eat part of a spare-rib," said Silas</line>
        <line>Foster, giving my hand a mighty squeeze. "I shall have these fat</line>
        <line>fellows hanging up by the heels, heads downward, pretty soon, I tell</line>
        <line>you!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"O cruel Silas, what a horrible idea!" cried "All the rest of us,</line>
        <line>men, women, and livestock, save only these four porkers, are bedevilled</line>
        <line>with one grief or another; they alone are happy,--and you mean to cut</line>
        <line>their throats and eat them! It would be more for the general comfort</line>
        <line>to let them eat us; and bitter and sour morsels we should be!"</line>
    </p>

    <p>
        <title>THE HOTEL</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Arriving in town (where my bachelor-rooms, long before this time, had</line>
        <line>received some other occupant), I established myself, for a day or two,</line>
        <line>in a certain, respectable hotel. It was situated somewhat aloof from</line>
        <line>my former track in life; my present mood inclining me to avoid most of</line>
        <line>my old companions, from whom I was now sundered by other interests, and</line>
        <line>who would have been likely enough to amuse themselves at the expense of</line>
        <line>the amateur workingman. The hotel-keeper put me into a back room of</line>
        <line>the third story of his spacious establishment. The day was lowering,</line>
        <line>with occasional gusts of rain, and an ugly tempered east wind, which</line>
        <line>seemed to come right off the chill and melancholy sea, hardly mitigated</line>
        <line>by sweeping over the roofs, and amalgamating itself with the dusky</line>
        <line>element of city smoke. All the effeminacy of past days had returned</line>
        <line>upon me at once. Summer as it still was, I ordered a coal fire in the</line>
        <line>rusty grate, and was glad to find myself growing a little too warm with</line>
        <line>an artificial temperature.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>My sensations were those of a traveller, long sojourning in remote</line>
        <line>regions, and at length sitting down again amid customs once familiar.</line>
        <line>There was a newness and an oldness oddly combining themselves into one</line>
        <line>impression. It made me acutely sensible how strange a piece of</line>
        <line>mosaic-work had lately been wrought into my life. True, if you look at</line>
        <line>it in one way, it had been only a summer in the country. But,</line>
        <line>considered in a profounder relation, it was part of another age, a</line>
        <line>different state of society, a segment of an existence peculiar in its</line>
        <line>aims and methods, a leaf of some mysterious volume interpolated into</line>
        <line>the current history which time was writing off. At one moment, the</line>
        <line>very circumstances now surrounding me--my coal fire and the dingy room</line>
        <line>in the bustling hotel--appeared far off and intangible; the next</line>
        <line>instant Blithedale looked vague, as if it were at a distance both in</line>
        <line>time and space, and so shadowy that a question might be raised whether</line>
        <line>the whole affair had been anything more than the thoughts of a</line>
        <line>speculative man. I had never before experienced a mood that so robbed</line>
        <line>the actual world of its solidity. It nevertheless involved a charm, on</line>
        <line>which--a devoted epicure of my own emotions--I resolved to pause, and</line>
        <line>enjoy the moral sillabub until quite dissolved away.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Whatever had been my taste for solitude and natural scenery, yet the</line>
        <line>thick, foggy, stifled element of cities, the entangled life of many men</line>
        <line>together, sordid as it was, and empty of the beautiful, took quite as</line>
        <line>strenuous a hold upon my mind. I felt as if there could never be</line>
        <line>enough of it. Each characteristic sound was too suggestive to be</line>
        <line>passed over unnoticed. Beneath and around me, I heard the stir of the</line>
        <line>hotel; the loud voices of guests, landlord, or bar-keeper; steps</line>
        <line>echoing on the staircase; the ringing of a bell, announcing arrivals or</line>
        <line>departures; the porter lumbering past my door with baggage, which he</line>
        <line>thumped down upon the floors of neighboring chambers; the lighter feet</line>
        <line>of chambermaids scudding along the passages;--it is ridiculous to think</line>
        <line>what an interest they had for me! From the street came the tumult of</line>
        <line>the pavements, pervading the whole house with a continual uproar, so</line>
        <line>broad and deep that only an unaccustomed ear would dwell upon it. A</line>
        <line>company of the city soldiery, with a full military band, marched in</line>
        <line>front of the hotel, invisible to me, but stirringly audible both by its</line>
        <line>foot-tramp and the clangor of its instruments. Once or twice all the</line>
        <line>city bells jangled together, announcing a fire, which brought out the</line>
        <line>engine-men and their machines, like an army with its artillery rushing</line>
        <line>to battle. Hour by hour the clocks in many steeples responded one to</line>
        <line>another.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>In some public hall, not a great way off, there seemed to be an</line>
        <line>exhibition of a mechanical diorama; for three times during the day</line>
        <line>occurred a repetition of obstreperous music, winding up with the rattle</line>
        <line>of imitative cannon and musketry, and a huge final explosion. Then</line>
        <line>ensued the applause of the spectators, with clap of hands and thump of</line>
        <line>sticks, and the energetic pounding of their heels. All this was just</line>
        <line>as valuable, in its way, as the sighing of the breeze among the</line>
        <line>birch-trees that overshadowed Eliot's pulpit.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Yet I felt a hesitation about plunging into this muddy tide of human</line>
        <line>activity and pastime. It suited me better, for the present, to linger</line>
        <line>on the brink, or hover in the air above it. So I spent the first day,</line>
        <line>and the greater part of the second, in the laziest manner possible, in</line>
        <line>a rocking-chair, inhaling the fragrance of a series of cigars, with my</line>
        <line>legs and slippered feet horizontally disposed, and in my hand a novel</line>
        <line>purchased of a railroad bibliopolist. The gradual waste of my cigar</line>
        <line>accomplished itself with an easy and gentle expenditure of breath. My</line>
        <line>book was of the dullest, yet had a sort of sluggish flow, like that of</line>
        <line>a stream in which your boat is as often aground as afloat. Had there</line>
        <line>been a more impetuous rush, a more absorbing passion of the narrative,</line>
        <line>I should the sooner have struggled out of its uneasy current, and have</line>
        <line>given myself up to the swell and subsidence of my thoughts. But, as it</line>
        <line>was, the torpid life of the book served as an unobtrusive accompaniment</line>
        <line>to the life within me and about me. At intervals, however, when its</line>
        <line>effect grew a little too soporific,--not for my patience, but for the</line>
        <line>possibility of keeping my eyes open, I bestirred myself, started from</line>
        <line>the rocking-chair, and looked out of the window.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>A gray sky; the weathercock of a steeple that rose beyond the opposite</line>
        <line>range of buildings, pointing from the eastward; a sprinkle of small,</line>
        <line>spiteful-looking raindrops on the window-pane. In that ebb-tide of my</line>
        <line>energies, had I thought of venturing abroad, these tokens would have</line>
        <line>checked the abortive purpose.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>After several such visits to the window, I found myself getting pretty</line>
        <line>well acquainted with that little portion of the backside of the</line>
        <line>universe which it presented to my view. Over against the hotel and its</line>
        <line>adjacent houses, at the distance of forty or fifty yards, was the rear</line>
        <line>of a range of buildings which appeared to be spacious, modern, and</line>
        <line>calculated for fashionable residences. The interval between was</line>
        <line>apportioned into grass-plots, and here and there an apology for a</line>
        <line>garden, pertaining severally to these dwellings. There were</line>
        <line>apple-trees, and pear and peach trees, too, the fruit on which looked</line>
        <line>singularly large, luxuriant, and abundant, as well it might, in a</line>
        <line>situation so warm and sheltered, and where the soil had doubtless been</line>
        <line>enriched to a more than natural fertility. In two or three places</line>
        <line>grapevines clambered upon trellises, and bore clusters already purple,</line>
        <line>and promising the richness of Malta or Madeira in their ripened juice.</line>
        <line>The blighting winds of our rigid climate could not molest these trees</line>
        <line>and vines; the sunshine, though descending late into this area, and too</line>
        <line>early intercepted by the height of the surrounding houses, yet lay</line>
        <line>tropically there, even when less than temperate in every other region.</line>
        <line>Dreary as was the day, the scene was illuminated by not a few sparrows</line>
        <line>and other birds, which spread their wings, and flitted and fluttered,</line>
        <line>and alighted now here, now there, and busily scratched their food out</line>
        <line>of the wormy earth. Most of these winged people seemed to have their</line>
        <line>domicile in a robust and healthy buttonwood-tree. It aspired upward,</line>
        <line>high above the roofs of the houses, and spread a dense head of foliage</line>
        <line>half across the area.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There was a cat--as there invariably is in such places--who evidently</line>
        <line>thought herself entitled to the privileges of forest life in this close</line>
        <line>heart of city conventionalisms. I watched her creeping along the low,</line>
        <line>flat roofs of the offices, descending a flight of wooden steps, gliding</line>
        <line>among the grass, and besieging the buttonwood-tree, with murderous</line>
        <line>purpose against its feathered citizens. But, after all, they were</line>
        <line>birds of city breeding, and doubtless knew how to guard themselves</line>
        <line>against the peculiar perils of their position.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Bewitching to my fancy are all those nooks and crannies where Nature,</line>
        <line>like a stray partridge, hides her head among the long-established</line>
        <line>haunts of men! It is likewise to be remarked, as a general rule, that</line>
        <line>there is far more of the picturesque, more truth to native and</line>
        <line>characteristic tendencies, and vastly greater suggestiveness in the</line>
        <line>back view of a residence, whether in town or country, than in its</line>
        <line>front. The latter is always artificial; it is meant for the world's</line>
        <line>eye, and is therefore a veil and a concealment. Realities keep in the</line>
        <line>rear, and put forward an advance guard of show and humbug. The</line>
        <line>posterior aspect of any old farmhouse, behind which a railroad has</line>
        <line>unexpectedly been opened, is so different from that looking upon the</line>
        <line>immemorial highway, that the spectator gets new ideas of rural life and</line>
        <line>individuality in the puff or two of steam-breath which shoots him past</line>
        <line>the premises. In a city, the distinction between what is offered to</line>
        <line>the public and what is kept for the family is certainly not less</line>
        <line>striking.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But, to return to my window at the back of the hotel. Together with a</line>
        <line>due contemplation of the fruit-trees, the grapevines, the</line>
        <line>buttonwood-tree, the cat, the birds, and many other particulars, I</line>
        <line>failed not to study the row of fashionable dwellings to which all these</line>
        <line>appertained. Here, it must be confessed, there was a general sameness.</line>
        <line>From the upper story to the first floor, they were so much alike, that</line>
        <line>I could only conceive of the inhabitants as cut out on one identical</line>
        <line>pattern, like little wooden toy-people of German manufacture. One</line>
        <line>long, united roof, with its thousands of slates glittering in the rain,</line>
        <line>extended over the whole. After the distinctness of separate characters</line>
        <line>to which I had recently been accustomed, it perplexed and annoyed me</line>
        <line>not to be able to resolve this combination of human interests into</line>
        <line>well-defined elements. It seemed hardly worth while for more than one</line>
        <line>of those families to be in existence, since they all had the same</line>
        <line>glimpse of the sky, all looked into the same area, all received just</line>
        <line>their equal share of sunshine through the front windows, and all</line>
        <line>listened to precisely the same noises of the street on which they</line>
        <line>boarded. Men are so much alike in their nature, that they grow</line>
        <line>intolerable unless varied by their circumstances.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Just about this time a waiter entered my room. The truth was, I had</line>
        <line>rung the bell and ordered a sherry-cobbler.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Can you tell me," I inquired, "what families reside in any of those</line>
        <line>houses opposite?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"The one right opposite is a rather stylish boarding-house," said the</line>
        <line>waiter. "Two of the gentlemen boarders keep horses at the stable of</line>
        <line>our establishment. They do things in very good style, sir, the people</line>
        <line>that live there."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I might have found out nearly as much for myself, on examining the</line>
        <line>house a little more closely, in one of the upper chambers I saw a young</line>
        <line>man in a dressing-gown, standing before the glass and brushing his hair</line>
        <line>for a quarter of an hour together. He then spent an equal space of</line>
        <line>time in the elaborate arrangement of his cravat, and finally made his</line>
        <line>appearance in a dress-coat, which I suspected to be newly come from the</line>
        <line>tailor's, and now first put on for a dinner-party. At a window of the</line>
        <line>next story below, two children, prettily dressed, were looking out. By</line>
        <line>and by a middle-aged gentleman came softly behind them, kissed the</line>
        <line>little girl, and playfully pulled the little boy's ear. It was a papa,</line>
        <line>no doubt, just come in from his counting-room or office; and anon</line>
        <line>appeared mamma, stealing as softly behind papa as he had stolen behind</line>
        <line>the children, and laying her hand on his shoulder to surprise him.</line>
        <line>Then followed a kiss between papa and mamma; but a noiseless one, for</line>
        <line>the children did not turn their heads.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I bless God for these good folks!" thought I to myself. "I have not</line>
        <line>seen a prettier bit of nature, in all my summer in the country, than</line>
        <line>they have shown me here, in a rather stylish boarding-house. I will</line>
        <line>pay them a little more attention by and by."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>On the first floor, an iron balustrade ran along in front of the tall</line>
        <line>and spacious windows, evidently belonging to a back drawing-room; and</line>
        <line>far into the interior, through the arch of the sliding-doors, I could</line>
        <line>discern a gleam from the windows of the front apartment. There were no</line>
        <line>signs of present occupancy in this suite of rooms; the curtains being</line>
        <line>enveloped in a protective covering, which allowed but a small portion</line>
        <line>of their crimson material to be seen. But two housemaids were</line>
        <line>industriously at work; so that there was good prospect that the</line>
        <line>boarding-house might not long suffer from the absence of its most</line>
        <line>expensive and profitable guests. Meanwhile, until they should appear,</line>
        <line>I cast my eyes downward to the lower regions. There, in the dusk that</line>
        <line>so early settles into such places, I saw the red glow of the kitchen</line>
        <line>range. The hot cook, or one of her subordinates, with a ladle in her</line>
        <line>hand, came to draw a cool breath at the back door. As soon as she</line>
        <line>disappeared, an Irish man-servant, in a white jacket, crept slyly</line>
        <line>forth, and threw away the fragments of a china dish, which,</line>
        <line>unquestionably, he had just broken. Soon afterwards, a lady, showily</line>
        <line>dressed, with a curling front of what must have been false hair, and</line>
        <line>reddish-brown, I suppose, in hue,--though my remoteness allowed me only</line>
        <line>to guess at such particulars,--this respectable mistress of the</line>
        <line>boarding-house made a momentary transit across the kitchen window, and</line>
        <line>appeared no more. It was her final, comprehensive glance, in order to</line>
        <line>make sure that soup, fish, and flesh were in a proper state of</line>
        <line>readiness, before the serving up of dinner.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There was nothing else worth noticing about the house, unless it be</line>
        <line>that on the peak of one of the dormer windows which opened out of the</line>
        <line>roof sat a dove, looking very dreary and forlorn; insomuch that I</line>
        <line>wondered why she chose to sit there, in the chilly rain, while her</line>
        <line>kindred were doubtless nestling in a warm and comfortable dove-cote.</line>
        <line>All at once this dove spread her wings, and, launching herself in the</line>
        <line>air, came flying so straight across the intervening space, that I fully</line>
        <line>expected her to alight directly on my window-sill. In the latter part</line>
        <line>of her course, however, she swerved aside, flew upward, and vanished,</line>
        <line>as did, likewise, the slight, fantastic pathos with which I had</line>
        <line>invested her.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>THE BOARDING-HOUSE</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The next day, as soon as I thought of looking again towards the</line>
        <line>opposite house, there sat the dove again, on the peak of the same</line>
        <line>dormer window! It was by no means an early hour, for the preceding</line>
        <line>evening I had ultimately mustered enterprise enough to visit the</line>
        <line>theatre, had gone late to bed, and slept beyond all limit, in my</line>
        <line>remoteness from Silas Foster's awakening horn. Dreams had tormented me</line>
        <line>throughout the night. The train of thoughts which, for months past,</line>
        <line>had worn a track through my mind, and to escape which was one of my</line>
        <line>chief objects in leaving Blithedale, kept treading remorselessly to and</line>
        <line>fro in their old footsteps, while slumber left me impotent to regulate</line>
        <line>them. It was not till I had quitted my three friends that they first</line>
        <line>began to encroach upon my dreams. In those of the last night,</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth and Zenobia, standing on either side of my bed, had bent</line>
        <line>across it to exchange a kiss of passion. Priscilla, beholding</line>
        <line>this,--for she seemed to be peeping in at the chamber window,--had</line>
        <line>melted gradually away, and left only the sadness of her expression in</line>
        <line>my heart. There it still lingered, after I awoke; one of those</line>
        <line>unreasonable sadnesses that you know not how to deal with, because it</line>
        <line>involves nothing for common-sense to clutch.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It was a gray and dripping forenoon; gloomy enough in town, and still</line>
        <line>gloomier in the haunts to which my recollections persisted in</line>
        <line>transporting me. For, in spite of my efforts to think of something</line>
        <line>else, I thought how the gusty rain was drifting over the slopes and</line>
        <line>valleys of our farm; how wet must be the foliage that overshadowed the</line>
        <line>pulpit rock; how cheerless, in such a day, my hermitage--the</line>
        <line>tree-solitude of my owl-like humors--in the vine-encircled heart of the</line>
        <line>tall pine! It was a phase of homesickness. I had wrenched myself too</line>
        <line>suddenly out of an accustomed sphere. There was no choice, now, but to</line>
        <line>bear the pang of whatever heartstrings were snapt asunder, and that</line>
        <line>illusive torment (like the ache of a limb long ago cut off) by which a</line>
        <line>past mode of life prolongs itself into the succeeding one. I was full</line>
        <line>of idle and shapeless regrets. The thought impressed itself upon me</line>
        <line>that I had left duties unperformed. With the power, perhaps, to act in</line>
        <line>the place of destiny and avert misfortune from my friends, I had</line>
        <line>resigned them to their fate. That cold tendency, between instinct and</line>
        <line>intellect, which made me pry with a speculative interest into people's</line>
        <line>passions and impulses, appeared to have gone far towards unhumanizing</line>
        <line>my heart.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But a man cannot always decide for himself whether his own heart is</line>
        <line>cold or warm. It now impresses me that, if I erred at all in regard to</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, Zenobia, and Priscilla, it was through too much</line>
        <line>sympathy, rather than too little.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>To escape the irksomeness of these meditations, I resumed my post at</line>
        <line>the window. At first sight, there was nothing new to be noticed. The</line>
        <line>general aspect of affairs was the same as yesterday, except that the</line>
        <line>more decided inclemency of to-day had driven the sparrows to shelter,</line>
        <line>and kept the cat within doors; whence, however, she soon emerged,</line>
        <line>pursued by the cook, and with what looked like the better half of a</line>
        <line>roast chicken in her mouth. The young man in the dress-coat was</line>
        <line>invisible; the two children, in the story below, seemed to be romping</line>
        <line>about the room, under the superintendence of a nursery-maid. The</line>
        <line>damask curtains of the drawing-room, on the first floor, were now fully</line>
        <line>displayed, festooned gracefully from top to bottom of the windows,</line>
        <line>which extended from the ceiling to the carpet. A narrower window, at</line>
        <line>the left of the drawing-room, gave light to what was probably a small</line>
        <line>boudoir, within which I caught the faintest imaginable glimpse of a</line>
        <line>girl's figure, in airy drapery. Her arm was in regular movement, as if</line>
        <line>she were busy with her German worsted, or some other such pretty and</line>
        <line>unprofitable handiwork.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>While intent upon making out this girlish shape, I became sensible that</line>
        <line>a figure had appeared at one of the windows of the drawing-room. There</line>
        <line>was a presentiment in my mind; or perhaps my first glance, imperfect</line>
        <line>and sidelong as it was, had sufficed to convey subtile information of</line>
        <line>the truth. At any rate, it was with no positive surprise, but as if I</line>
        <line>had all along expected the incident, that, directing my eyes</line>
        <line>thitherward, I beheld--like a full-length picture, in the space between</line>
        <line>the heavy festoons of the window curtains--no other than Zenobia! At</line>
        <line>the same instant, my thoughts made sure of the identity of the figure</line>
        <line>in the boudoir. It could only be Priscilla.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia was attired, not in the almost rustic costume which she had</line>
        <line>heretofore worn, but in a fashionable morning-dress. There was,</line>
        <line>nevertheless, one familiar point. She had, as usual, a flower in her</line>
        <line>hair, brilliant and of a rare variety, else it had not been Zenobia.</line>
        <line>After a brief pause at the window, she turned away, exemplifying, in</line>
        <line>the few steps that removed her out of sight, that noble and beautiful</line>
        <line>motion which characterized her as much as any other personal charm. Not</line>
        <line>one woman in a thousand could move so admirably as Zenobia. Many women</line>
        <line>can sit gracefully; some can stand gracefully; and a few, perhaps, can</line>
        <line>assume a series of graceful positions. But natural movement is the</line>
        <line>result and expression of the whole being, and cannot be well and nobly</line>
        <line>performed unless responsive to something in the character. I often</line>
        <line>used to think that music--light and airy, wild and passionate, or the</line>
        <line>full harmony of stately marches, in accordance with her varying</line>
        <line>mood--should have attended Zenobia's footsteps.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I waited for her reappearance. It was one peculiarity, distinguishing</line>
        <line>Zenobia from most of her sex, that she needed for her moral well-being,</line>
        <line>and never would forego, a large amount of physical exercise. At</line>
        <line>Blithedale, no inclemency of sky or muddiness of earth had ever impeded</line>
        <line>her daily walks. Here in town, she probably preferred to tread the</line>
        <line>extent of the two drawing-rooms, and measure out the miles by spaces of</line>
        <line>forty feet, rather than bedraggle her skirts over the sloppy pavements.</line>
        <line>Accordingly, in about the time requisite to pass through the arch of</line>
        <line>the sliding-doors to the front window, and to return upon her steps,</line>
        <line>there she stood again, between the festoons of the crimson curtains.</line>
        <line>But another personage was now added to the scene. Behind Zenobia</line>
        <line>appeared that face which I had first encountered in the wood-path; the</line>
        <line>man who had passed, side by side with her, in such mysterious</line>
        <line>familiarity and estrangement, beneath my vine curtained hermitage in</line>
        <line>the tall pine-tree. It was Westervelt. And though he was looking</line>
        <line>closely over her shoulder, it still seemed to me, as on the former</line>
        <line>occasion, that Zenobia repelled him,--that, perchance, they mutually</line>
        <line>repelled each other, by some incompatibility of their spheres.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>This impression, however, might have been altogether the result of</line>
        <line>fancy and prejudice in me. The distance was so great as to obliterate</line>
        <line>any play of feature by which I might otherwise have been made a</line>
        <line>partaker of their counsels.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There now needed only Hollingsworth and old Moodie to complete the knot</line>
        <line>of characters, whom a real intricacy of events, greatly assisted by my</line>
        <line>method of insulating them from other relations, had kept so long upon</line>
        <line>my mental stage, as actors in a drama. In itself, perhaps, it was no</line>
        <line>very remarkable event that they should thus come across me, at the</line>
        <line>moment when I imagined myself free. Zenobia, as I well knew, had</line>
        <line>retained an establishment in town, and had not unfrequently withdrawn</line>
        <line>herself from Blithedale during brief intervals, on one of which</line>
        <line>occasions she had taken Priscilla along with her. Nevertheless, there</line>
        <line>seemed something fatal in the coincidence that had borne me to this one</line>
        <line>spot, of all others in a great city, and transfixed me there, and</line>
        <line>compelled me again to waste my already wearied sympathies on affairs</line>
        <line>which were none of mine, and persons who cared little for me. It</line>
        <line>irritated my nerves; it affected me with a kind of heart-sickness.</line>
        <line>After the effort which it cost me to fling them off,--after</line>
        <line>consummating my escape, as I thought, from these goblins of flesh and</line>
        <line>blood, and pausing to revive myself with a breath or two of an</line>
        <line>atmosphere in which they should have no share,--it was a positive</line>
        <line>despair to find the same figures arraying themselves before me, and</line>
        <line>presenting their old problem in a shape that made it more insoluble</line>
        <line>than ever.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I began to long for a catastrophe. If the noble temper of</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's soul were doomed to be utterly corrupted by the too</line>
        <line>powerful purpose which had grown out of what was noblest in him; if the</line>
        <line>rich and generous qualities of Zenobia's womanhood might not save her;</line>
        <line>if Priscilla must perish by her tenderness and faith, so simple and so</line>
        <line>devout, then be it so! Let it all come! As for me, I would look on,</line>
        <line>as it seemed my part to do, understandingly, if my intellect could</line>
        <line>fathom the meaning and the moral, and, at all events, reverently and</line>
        <line>sadly. The curtain fallen, I would pass onward with my poor individual</line>
        <line>life, which was now attenuated of much of its proper substance, and</line>
        <line>diffused among many alien interests.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Meanwhile, Zenobia and her companion had retreated from the window.</line>
        <line>Then followed an interval, during which I directed my eves towards the</line>
        <line>figure in the boudoir. Most certainly it was Priscilla, although</line>
        <line>dressed with a novel and fanciful elegance. The vague perception of</line>
        <line>it, as viewed so far off, impressed me as if she had suddenly passed</line>
        <line>out of a chrysalis state and put forth wings. Her hands were not now</line>
        <line>in motion. She had dropt her work, and sat with her head thrown back,</line>
        <line>in the same attitude that I had seen several times before, when she</line>
        <line>seemed to be listening to an imperfectly distinguished sound.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Again the two figures in the drawing-room became visible. They were</line>
        <line>now a little withdrawn from the window, face to face, and, as I could</line>
        <line>see by Zenobia's emphatic gestures, were discussing some subject in</line>
        <line>which she, at least, felt a passionate concern. By and by she broke</line>
        <line>away, and vanished beyond my ken. Westervelt approached the window,</line>
        <line>and leaned his forehead against a pane of glass, displaying the sort of</line>
        <line>smile on his handsome features which, when I before met him, had let me</line>
        <line>into the secret of his gold-bordered teeth. Every human being, when</line>
        <line>given over to the Devil, is sure to have the wizard mark upon him, in</line>
        <line>one form or another. I fancied that this smile, with its peculiar</line>
        <line>revelation, was the Devil's signet on the Professor.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>This man, as I had soon reason to know, was endowed with a cat-like</line>
        <line>circumspection; and though precisely the most unspiritual quality in</line>
        <line>the world, it was almost as effective as spiritual insight in making</line>
        <line>him acquainted with whatever it suited him to discover. He now proved</line>
        <line>it, considerably to my discomfiture, by detecting and recognizing me,</line>
        <line>at my post of observation. Perhaps I ought to have blushed at being</line>
        <line>caught in such an evident scrutiny of Professor Westervelt and his</line>
        <line>affairs. Perhaps I did blush. Be that as it might, I retained</line>
        <line>presence of mind enough not to make my position yet more irksome by the</line>
        <line>poltroonery of drawing back.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Westervelt looked into the depths of the drawing-room, and beckoned.</line>
        <line>Immediately afterwards Zenobia appeared at the window, with color much</line>
        <line>heightened, and eyes which, as my conscience whispered me, were</line>
        <line>shooting bright arrows, barbed with scorn, across the intervening</line>
        <line>space, directed full at my sensibilities as a gentleman. If the truth</line>
        <line>must be told, far as her flight-shot was, those arrows hit the mark.</line>
        <line>She signified her recognition of me by a gesture with her head and</line>
        <line>hand, comprising at once a salutation and dismissal. The next moment</line>
        <line>she administered one of those pitiless rebukes which a woman always has</line>
        <line>at hand, ready for any offence (and which she so seldom spares on due</line>
        <line>occasion), by letting down a white linen curtain between the festoons</line>
        <line>of the damask ones. It fell like the drop-curtain of a theatre, in the</line>
        <line>interval between the acts.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Priscilla had disappeared from the boudoir. But the dove still kept</line>
        <line>her desolate perch on the peak of the attic window.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>ZENOBIA'S DRAWING-ROOM</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The remainder of the day, so far as I was concerned, was spent in</line>
        <line>meditating on these recent incidents. I contrived, and alternately</line>
        <line>rejected, innumerable methods of accounting for the presence of Zenobia</line>
        <line>and Priscilla, and the connection of Westervelt with both. It must be</line>
        <line>owned, too, that I had a keen, revengeful sense of the insult inflicted</line>
        <line>by Zenobia's scornful recognition, and more particularly by her letting</line>
        <line>down the curtain; as if such were the proper barrier to be interposed</line>
        <line>between a character like hers and a perceptive faculty like mine. For,</line>
        <line>was mine a mere vulgar curiosity? Zenobia should have known me better</line>
        <line>than to suppose it. She should have been able to appreciate that</line>
        <line>quality of the intellect and the heart which impelled me (often against</line>
        <line>my own will, and to the detriment of my own comfort) to live in other</line>
        <line>lives, and to endeavor--by generous sympathies, by delicate intuitions,</line>
        <line>by taking note of things too slight for record, and by bringing my</line>
        <line>human spirit into manifold accordance with the companions whom God</line>
        <line>assigned me--to learn the secret which was hidden even from themselves.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Of all possible observers, methought a woman like Zenobia and a man</line>
        <line>like Hollingsworth should have selected me. And now when the event has</line>
        <line>long been past, I retain the same opinion of my fitness for the office.</line>
        <line>True, I might have condemned them. Had I been judge as well as</line>
        <line>witness, my sentence might have been stern as that of destiny itself.</line>
        <line>But, still, no trait of original nobility of character, no struggle</line>
        <line>against temptation,--no iron necessity of will, on the one hand, nor</line>
        <line>extenuating circumstance to be derived from passion and despair, on the</line>
        <line>other,--no remorse that might coexist with error, even if powerless to</line>
        <line>prevent it,--no proud repentance that should claim retribution as a</line>
        <line>meed,--would go unappreciated. True, again, I might give my full</line>
        <line>assent to the punishment which was sure to follow. But it would be</line>
        <line>given mournfully, and with undiminished love. And, after all was</line>
        <line>finished, I would come as if to gather up the white ashes of those who</line>
        <line>had perished at the stake, and to tell the world--the wrong being now</line>
        <line>atoned for--how much had perished there which it had never yet known</line>
        <line>how to praise.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I sat in my rocking-chair, too far withdrawn from the window to expose</line>
        <line>myself to another rebuke like that already inflicted. My eyes still</line>
        <line>wandered towards the opposite house, but without effecting any new</line>
        <line>discoveries. Late in the afternoon, the weathercock on the church</line>
        <line>spire indicated a change of wind; the sun shone dimly out, as if the</line>
        <line>golden wine of its beams were mingled half-and-half with water.</line>
        <line>Nevertheless, they kindled up the whole range of edifices, threw a glow</line>
        <line>over the windows, glistened on the wet roofs, and, slowly withdrawing</line>
        <line>upward, perched upon the chimney-tops; thence they took a higher</line>
        <line>flight, and lingered an instant on the tip of the spire, making it the</line>
        <line>final point of more cheerful light in the whole sombre scene. The next</line>
        <line>moment, it was all gone. The twilight fell into the area like a shower</line>
        <line>of dusky snow, and before it was quite dark, the gong of the hotel</line>
        <line>summoned me to tea.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>When I returned to my chamber, the glow of an astral lamp was</line>
        <line>penetrating mistily through the white curtain of Zenobia's</line>
        <line>drawing-room. The shadow of a passing figure was now and then cast</line>
        <line>upon this medium, but with too vague an outline for even my adventurous</line>
        <line>conjectures to read the hieroglyphic that it presented.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>All at once, it occurred to me how very absurd was my behavior in thus</line>
        <line>tormenting myself with crazy hypotheses as to what was going on within</line>
        <line>that drawing-room, when it was at my option to be personally present</line>
        <line>there, My relations with Zenobia, as yet unchanged,--as a familiar</line>
        <line>friend, and associated in the same life-long enterprise,--gave me the</line>
        <line>right, and made it no more than kindly courtesy demanded, to call on</line>
        <line>her. Nothing, except our habitual independence of conventional rules</line>
        <line>at Blithedale, could have kept me from sooner recognizing this duty.</line>
        <line>At all events, it should now be performed.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>In compliance with this sudden impulse, I soon found myself actually</line>
        <line>within the house, the rear of which, for two days past, I had been so</line>
        <line>sedulously watching. A servant took my card, and, immediately</line>
        <line>returning, ushered me upstairs. On the way, I heard a rich, and, as it</line>
        <line>were, triumphant burst of music from a piano, in which I felt Zenobia's</line>
        <line>character, although heretofore I had known nothing of her skill upon</line>
        <line>the instrument. Two or three canary-birds, excited by this gush of</line>
        <line>sound, sang piercingly, and did their utmost to produce a kindred</line>
        <line>melody. A bright illumination streamed through, the door of the front</line>
        <line>drawing-room; and I had barely stept across the threshold before</line>
        <line>Zenobia came forward to meet me, laughing, and with an extended hand.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, Mr. Coverdale," said she, still smiling, but, as I thought, with a</line>
        <line>good deal of scornful anger underneath, "it has gratified me to see the</line>
        <line>interest which you continue to take in my affairs! I have long</line>
        <line>recognized you as a sort of transcendental Yankee, with all the native</line>
        <line>propensity of your countrymen to investigate matters that come within</line>
        <line>their range, but rendered almost poetical, in your case, by the refined</line>
        <line>methods which you adopt for its gratification. After all, it was an</line>
        <line>unjustifiable stroke, on my part,--was it not?--to let down the window</line>
        <line>curtain!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I cannot call it a very wise one," returned I, with a secret</line>
        <line>bitterness, which, no doubt, Zenobia appreciated. "It is really</line>
        <line>impossible to hide anything in this world, to say nothing of the next.</line>
        <line>All that we ought to ask, therefore, is, that the witnesses of our</line>
        <line>conduct, and the speculators on our motives, should be capable of</line>
        <line>taking the highest view which the circumstances of the case may admit.</line>
        <line>So much being secured, I, for one, would be most happy in feeling</line>
        <line>myself followed everywhere by an indefatigable human sympathy."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"We must trust for intelligent sympathy to our guardian angels, if any</line>
        <line>there be," said Zenobia. "As long as the only spectator of my poor</line>
        <line>tragedy is a young man at the window of his hotel, I must still claim</line>
        <line>the liberty to drop the curtain."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>While this passed, as Zenobia's hand was extended, I had applied the</line>
        <line>very slightest touch of my fingers to her own. In spite of an external</line>
        <line>freedom, her manner made me sensible that we stood upon no real terms</line>
        <line>of confidence. The thought came sadly across me, how great was the</line>
        <line>contrast betwixt this interview and our first meeting. Then, in the</line>
        <line>warm light of the country fireside, Zenobia had greeted me cheerily and</line>
        <line>hopefully, with a full sisterly grasp of the hand, conveying as much</line>
        <line>kindness in it as other women could have evinced by the pressure of</line>
        <line>both arms around my neck, or by yielding a cheek to the brotherly</line>
        <line>salute. The difference was as complete as between her appearance at</line>
        <line>that time--so simply attired, and with only the one superb flower in</line>
        <line>her hair--and now, when her beauty was set off by all that dress and</line>
        <line>ornament could do for it. And they did much. Not, indeed, that they</line>
        <line>created or added anything to what Nature had lavishly done for Zenobia.</line>
        <line>But, those costly robes which she had on, those flaming jewels on her</line>
        <line>neck, served as lamps to display the personal advantages which required</line>
        <line>nothing less than such an illumination to be fully seen. Even her</line>
        <line>characteristic flower, though it seemed to be still there, had</line>
        <line>undergone a cold and bright transfiguration; it was a flower</line>
        <line>exquisitely imitated in jeweller's work, and imparting the last touch</line>
        <line>that transformed Zenobia into a work of art.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I scarcely feel," I could not forbear saying, "as if we had ever met</line>
        <line>before. How many years ago it seems since we last sat beneath Eliot's</line>
        <line>pulpit, with Hollingsworth extended on the fallen leaves, and Priscilla</line>
        <line>at his feet! Can it be, Zenobia, that you ever really numbered</line>
        <line>yourself with our little band of earnest, thoughtful, philanthropic</line>
        <line>laborers?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Those ideas have their time and place," she answered coldly. "But I</line>
        <line>fancy it must be a very circumscribed mind that can find room for no</line>
        <line>other."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Her manner bewildered me. Literally, moreover, I was dazzled by the</line>
        <line>brilliancy of the room. A chandelier hung down in the centre, glowing</line>
        <line>with I know not how many lights; there were separate lamps, also, on</line>
        <line>two or three tables, and on marble brackets, adding their white</line>
        <line>radiance to that of the chandelier. The furniture was exceedingly</line>
        <line>rich. Fresh from our old farmhouse, with its homely board and benches</line>
        <line>in the dining-room, and a few wicker chairs in the best parlor, it</line>
        <line>struck me that here was the fulfilment of every fantasy of an</line>
        <line>imagination revelling in various methods of costly self-indulgence and</line>
        <line>splendid ease. Pictures, marbles, vases,--in brief, more shapes of</line>
        <line>luxury than there could be any object in enumerating, except for an</line>
        <line>auctioneer's advertisement,--and the whole repeated and doubled by the</line>
        <line>reflection of a great mirror, which showed me Zenobia's proud figure,</line>
        <line>likewise, and my own. It cost me, I acknowledge, a bitter sense of</line>
        <line>shame, to perceive in myself a positive effort to bear up against the</line>
        <line>effect which Zenobia sought to impose on me. I reasoned against her,</line>
        <line>in my secret mind, and strove so to keep my footing. In the</line>
        <line>gorgeousness with which she had surrounded herself,--in the redundance</line>
        <line>of personal ornament, which the largeness of her physical nature and</line>
        <line>the rich type of her beauty caused to seem so suitable,--I malevolently</line>
        <line>beheld the true character of the woman, passionate, luxurious, lacking</line>
        <line>simplicity, not deeply refined, incapable of pure and perfect taste.</line>
        <line>But, the next instant, she was too powerful for all my opposing</line>
        <line>struggles. I saw how fit it was that she should make herself as</line>
        <line>gorgeous as she pleased, and should do a thousand things that would</line>
        <line>have been ridiculous in the poor, thin, weakly characters of other</line>
        <line>women. To this day, however, I hardly know whether I then beheld</line>
        <line>Zenobia in her truest attitude, or whether that were the truer one in</line>
        <line>which she had presented herself at Blithedale. In both, there was</line>
        <line>something like the illusion which a great actress flings around her.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Have you given up Blithedale forever?" I inquired.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Why should you think so?" asked she.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I cannot tell," answered I; "except that it appears all like a dream</line>
        <line>that we were ever there together."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It is not so to me," said Zenobia. "I should think it a poor and</line>
        <line>meagre nature that is capable of but one set of forms, and must convert</line>
        <line>all the past into a dream merely because the present happens to be</line>
        <line>unlike it. Why should we be content with our homely life of a few</line>
        <line>months past, to the exclusion of all other modes? It was good; but</line>
        <line>there are other lives as good, or better. Not, you will understand,</line>
        <line>that I condemn those who give themselves up to it more entirely than I,</line>
        <line>for myself, should deem it wise to do."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It irritated me, this self-complacent, condescending, qualified</line>
        <line>approval and criticism of a system to which many individuals--perhaps</line>
        <line>as highly endowed as our gorgeous Zenobia--had contributed their all of</line>
        <line>earthly endeavor, and their loftiest aspirations. I determined to make</line>
        <line>proof if there were any spell that would exorcise her out of the part</line>
        <line>which she seemed to be acting. She should be compelled to give me a</line>
        <line>glimpse of something true; some nature, some passion, no matter whether</line>
        <line>right or wrong, provided it were real.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Your allusion to that class of circumscribed characters who can live</line>
        <line>only in one mode of life," remarked I coolly, "reminds me of our poor</line>
        <line>friend Hollingsworth. Possibly he was in your thoughts when you spoke</line>
        <line>thus. Poor fellow! It is a pity that, by the fault of a narrow</line>
        <line>education, he should have so completely immolated himself to that one</line>
        <line>idea of his, especially as the slightest modicum of common-sense would</line>
        <line>teach him its utter impracticability. Now that I have returned into</line>
        <line>the world, and can look at his project from a distance, it requires</line>
        <line>quite all my real regard for this respectable and well-intentioned man</line>
        <line>to prevent me laughing at him,--as I find society at large does."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia's eyes darted lightning, her cheeks flushed, the vividness of</line>
        <line>her expression was like the effect of a powerful light flaming up</line>
        <line>suddenly within her. My experiment had fully succeeded. She had shown</line>
        <line>me the true flesh and blood of her heart, by thus involuntarily</line>
        <line>resenting my slight, pitying, half-kind, half-scornful mention of the</line>
        <line>man who was all in all with her. She herself probably felt this; for</line>
        <line>it was hardly a moment before she tranquillized her uneven breath, and</line>
        <line>seemed as proud and self-possessed as ever.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I rather imagine," said she quietly, "that your appreciation falls</line>
        <line>short of Mr. Hollingsworth's just claims. Blind enthusiasm, absorption</line>
        <line>in one idea, I grant, is generally ridiculous, and must be fatal to the</line>
        <line>respectability of an ordinary man; it requires a very high and powerful</line>
        <line>character to make it otherwise. But a great man--as, perhaps, you do</line>
        <line>not know--attains his normal condition only through the inspiration of</line>
        <line>one great idea. As a friend of Mr. Hollingsworth, and, at the same</line>
        <line>time, a calm observer, I must tell you that he seems to me such a man.</line>
        <line>But you are very pardonable for fancying him ridiculous. Doubtless, he</line>
        <line>is so--to you! There can be no truer test of the noble and heroic, in</line>
        <line>any individual, than the degree in which he possesses the faculty of</line>
        <line>distinguishing heroism from absurdity."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I dared make no retort to Zenobia's concluding apothegm. In truth, I</line>
        <line>admired her fidelity. It gave me a new sense of Hollingsworth's native</line>
        <line>power, to discover that his influence was no less potent with this</line>
        <line>beautiful woman here, in the midst of artificial life, than it had been</line>
        <line>at the foot of the gray rock, and among the wild birch-trees of the</line>
        <line>wood-path, when she so passionately pressed his hand against her heart.</line>
        <line>The great, rude, shaggy, swarthy man! And Zenobia loved him!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Did you bring Priscilla with you?" I resumed. "Do you know I have</line>
        <line>sometimes fancied it not quite safe, considering the susceptibility of</line>
        <line>her temperament, that she should be so constantly within the sphere of</line>
        <line>a man like Hollingsworth. Such tender and delicate natures, among your</line>
        <line>sex, have often, I believe, a very adequate appreciation of the heroic</line>
        <line>element in men. But then, again, I should suppose them as likely as</line>
        <line>any other women to make a reciprocal impression. Hollingsworth could</line>
        <line>hardly give his affections to a person capable of taking an independent</line>
        <line>stand, but only to one whom he might absorb into himself. He has</line>
        <line>certainly shown great tenderness for Priscilla."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia had turned aside. But I caught the reflection of her face in</line>
        <line>the mirror, and saw that it was very pale,--as pale, in her rich</line>
        <line>attire, as if a shroud were round her.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Priscilla is here," said she, her voice a little lower than usual.</line>
        <line>"Have not you learnt as much from your chamber window? Would you like</line>
        <line>to see her?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She made a step or two into the back drawing-room, and</line>
        <line>called,--"Priscilla! Dear Priscilla!"</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>THEY VANISH</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Priscilla immediately answered the summons, and made her appearance</line>
        <line>through the door of the boudoir. I had conceived the idea, which I now</line>
        <line>recognized as a very foolish one, that Zenobia would have taken</line>
        <line>measures to debar me from an interview with this girl, between whom and</line>
        <line>herself there was so utter an opposition of their dearest interests,</line>
        <line>that, on one part or the other, a great grief, if not likewise a great</line>
        <line>wrong, seemed a matter of necessity. But, as Priscilla was only a leaf</line>
        <line>floating on the dark current of events, without influencing them by her</line>
        <line>own choice or plan, as she probably guessed not whither the stream was</line>
        <line>bearing her, nor perhaps even felt its inevitable movement,--there</line>
        <line>could be no peril of her communicating to me any intelligence with</line>
        <line>regard to Zenobia's purposes.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>On perceiving me, she came forward with great quietude of manner; and</line>
        <line>when I held out my hand, her own moved slightly towards it, as if</line>
        <line>attracted by a feeble degree of magnetism.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I am glad to see you, my dear Priscilla," said I, still holding her</line>
        <line>hand; "but everything that I meet with nowadays makes me wonder whether</line>
        <line>I am awake. You, especially, have always seemed like a figure in a</line>
        <line>dream, and now more than ever."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Oh, there is substance in these fingers of mine," she answered, giving</line>
        <line>my hand the faintest possible pressure, and then taking away her own.</line>
        <line>"Why do you call me a dream? Zenobia is much more like one than I; she</line>
        <line>is so very, very beautiful! And, I suppose," added Priscilla, as if</line>
        <line>thinking aloud, "everybody sees it, as I do."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But, for my part, it was Priscilla's beauty, not Zenobia's, of which I</line>
        <line>was thinking at that moment. She was a person who could be quite</line>
        <line>obliterated, so far as beauty went, by anything unsuitable in her</line>
        <line>attire; her charm was not positive and material enough to bear up</line>
        <line>against a mistaken choice of color, for instance, or fashion. It was</line>
        <line>safest, in her case, to attempt no art of dress; for it demanded the</line>
        <line>most perfect taste, or else the happiest accident in the world, to give</line>
        <line>her precisely the adornment which she needed. She was now dressed in</line>
        <line>pure white, set off with some kind of a gauzy fabric, which--as I bring</line>
        <line>up her figure in my memory, with a faint gleam on her shadowy hair, and</line>
        <line>her dark eyes bent shyly on mine, through all the vanished years--seems</line>
        <line>to be floating about her like a mist. I wondered what Zenobia meant by</line>
        <line>evolving so much loveliness out of this poor girl. It was what few</line>
        <line>women could afford to do; for, as I looked from one to the other, the</line>
        <line>sheen and splendor of Zenobia's presence took nothing from Priscilla's</line>
        <line>softer spell, if it might not rather be thought to add to it.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What do you think of her?" asked Zenobia.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I could not understand the look of melancholy kindness with which</line>
        <line>Zenobia regarded her. She advanced a step, and beckoning Priscilla</line>
        <line>near her, kissed her cheek; then, with a slight gesture of repulse, she</line>
        <line>moved to the other side of the room. I followed.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"She is a wonderful creature," I said. "Ever since she came among us,</line>
        <line>I have been dimly sensible of just this charm which you have brought</line>
        <line>out. But it was never absolutely visible till now. She is as lovely</line>
        <line>as a flower!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, say so if you like," answered Zenobia. "You are a poet,--at</line>
        <line>least, as poets go nowadays,--and must be allowed to make an</line>
        <line>opera-glass of your imagination, when you look at women. I wonder, in</line>
        <line>such Arcadian freedom of falling in love as we have lately enjoyed, it</line>
        <line>never occurred to you to fall in love with Priscilla. In society,</line>
        <line>indeed, a genuine American never dreams of stepping across the</line>
        <line>inappreciable air-line which separates one class from another. But</line>
        <line>what was rank to the colonists of Blithedale?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"There were other reasons," I replied, "why I should have demonstrated</line>
        <line>myself an ass, had I fallen in love with Priscilla. By the bye, has</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth ever seen her in this dress?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Why do you bring up his name at every turn?" asked Zenobia in an</line>
        <line>undertone, and with a malign look which wandered from my face to</line>
        <line>Priscilla's. "You know not what you do! It is dangerous, sir, believe</line>
        <line>me, to tamper thus with earnest human passions, out of your own mere</line>
        <line>idleness, and for your sport. I will endure it no longer! Take care</line>
        <line>that it does not happen again! I warn you!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You partly wrong me, if not wholly," I responded. "It is an uncertain</line>
        <line>sense of some duty to perform, that brings my thoughts, and therefore</line>
        <line>my words, continually to that one point."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Oh, this stale excuse of duty!" said Zenobia, in a whisper so full of</line>
        <line>scorn that it penetrated me like the hiss of a serpent. "I have often</line>
        <line>heard it before, from those who sought to interfere with me, and I know</line>
        <line>precisely what it signifies. Bigotry; self-conceit; an insolent</line>
        <line>curiosity; a meddlesome temper; a cold-blooded criticism, founded on a</line>
        <line>shallow interpretation of half-perceptions; a monstrous scepticism in</line>
        <line>regard to any conscience or any wisdom, except one's own; a most</line>
        <line>irreverent propensity to thrust Providence aside, and substitute one's</line>
        <line>self in its awful place,--out of these, and other motives as miserable</line>
        <line>as these, comes your idea of duty! But, beware, sir! With all your</line>
        <line>fancied acuteness, you step blindfold into these affairs. For any</line>
        <line>mischief that may follow your interference, I hold you responsible!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It was evident that, with but a little further provocation, the lioness</line>
        <line>would turn to bay; if, indeed, such were not her attitude already. I</line>
        <line>bowed, and not very well knowing what else to do, was about to</line>
        <line>withdraw. But, glancing again towards Priscilla, who had retreated</line>
        <line>into a corner, there fell upon my heart an intolerable burden of</line>
        <line>despondency, the purport of which I could not tell, but only felt it to</line>
        <line>bear reference to her. I approached and held out my hand; a gesture,</line>
        <line>however, to which she made no response. It was always one of her</line>
        <line>peculiarities that she seemed to shrink from even the most friendly</line>
        <line>touch, unless it were Zenobia's or Hollingsworth's. Zenobia, all this</line>
        <line>while, stood watching us, but with a careless expression, as if it</line>
        <line>mattered very little what might pass.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Priscilla," I inquired, lowering my voice, "when do you go back to</line>
        <line>Blithedale?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Whenever they please to take me," said she.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Did you come away of your own free will?" I asked.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I am blown about like a leaf," she replied. "I never have any free</line>
        <line>will."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Does Hollingsworth know that you are here?" said I.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"He bade me come," answered Priscilla.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She looked at me, I thought, with an air of surprise, as if the idea</line>
        <line>were incomprehensible that she should have taken this step without his</line>
        <line>agency.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What a gripe this man has laid upon her whole being!" muttered I</line>
        <line>between my teeth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, as Zenobia so kindly intimates, I have no more business here. I</line>
        <line>wash my hands of it all. On Hollingsworth's head be the consequences!</line>
        <line>Priscilla," I added aloud, "I know not that ever we may meet again.</line>
        <line>Farewell!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As I spoke the word, a carriage had rumbled along the street, and stopt</line>
        <line>before the house. The doorbell rang, and steps were immediately</line>
        <line>afterwards heard on the staircase. Zenobia had thrown a shawl over her</line>
        <line>dress.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Mr. Coverdale," said she, with cool courtesy, "you will perhaps excuse</line>
        <line>us. We have an engagement, and are going out."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Whither?" I demanded.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Is not that a little more than you are entitled to inquire?" said she,</line>
        <line>with a smile. "At all events, it does not suit me to tell you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The door of the drawing-room opened, and Westervelt appeared. I</line>
        <line>observed that he was elaborately dressed, as if for some grand</line>
        <line>entertainment. My dislike for this man was infinite. At that moment</line>
        <line>it amounted to nothing less than a creeping of the flesh, as when,</line>
        <line>feeling about in a dark place, one touches something cold and slimy,</line>
        <line>and questions what the secret hatefulness may be. And still I could</line>
        <line>not but acknowledge that, for personal beauty, for polish of manner,</line>
        <line>for all that externally befits a gentleman, there was hardly another</line>
        <line>like him. After bowing to Zenobia, and graciously saluting Priscilla</line>
        <line>in her corner, he recognized me by a slight but courteous inclination.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Come, Priscilla," said Zenobia; "it is time. Mr. Coverdale,</line>
        <line>good-evening."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As Priscilla moved slowly forward, I met her in the middle of the</line>
        <line>drawing-room.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Priscilla," said I, in the hearing of them all, "do you know whither</line>
        <line>you are going?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I do not know," she answered.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Is it wise to go, and is it your choice to go?" I asked. "If not, I</line>
        <line>am your friend, and Hollingsworth's friend. Tell me so, at once."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Possibly," observed Westervelt, smiling, "Priscilla sees in me an</line>
        <line>older friend than either Mr. Coverdale or Mr. Hollingsworth. I shall</line>
        <line>willingly leave the matter at her option."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>While thus speaking, he made a gesture of kindly invitation, and</line>
        <line>Priscilla passed me, with the gliding movement of a sprite, and took</line>
        <line>his offered arm. He offered the other to Zenobia; but she turned her</line>
        <line>proud and beautiful face upon him with a look which--judging from what</line>
        <line>I caught of it in profile--would undoubtedly have smitten the man dead,</line>
        <line>had he possessed any heart, or had this glance attained to it. It</line>
        <line>seemed to rebound, however, from his courteous visage, like an arrow</line>
        <line>from polished steel. They all three descended the stairs; and when I</line>
        <line>likewise reached the street door, the carriage was already rolling away.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Thus excluded from everybody's confidence, and attaining no further, by</line>
        <line>my most earnest study, than to an uncertain sense of something hidden</line>
        <line>from me, it would appear reasonable that I should have flung off all</line>
        <line>these alien perplexities. Obviously, my best course was to betake</line>
        <line>myself to new scenes. Here I was only an intruder. Elsewhere there</line>
        <line>might be circumstances in which I could establish a personal interest,</line>
        <line>and people who would respond, with a portion of their sympathies, for</line>
        <line>so much as I should bestow of mine.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Nevertheless, there occurred to me one other thing to be done.</line>
        <line>Remembering old Moodie, and his relationship with Priscilla, I</line>
        <line>determined to seek an interview, for the purpose of ascertaining</line>
        <line>whether the knot of affairs was as inextricable on that side as I found</line>
        <line>it on all others. Being tolerably well acquainted with the old man's</line>
        <line>haunts, I went, the next day, to the saloon of a certain establishment</line>
        <line>about which he often lurked. It was a reputable place enough,</line>
        <line>affording good entertainment in the way of meat, drink, and fumigation;</line>
        <line>and there, in my young and idle days and nights, when I was neither</line>
        <line>nice nor wise, I had often amused myself with watching the staid humors</line>
        <line>and sober jollities of the thirsty souls around me.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>At my first entrance, old Moodie was not there. The more patiently to</line>
        <line>await him, I lighted a cigar, and establishing myself in a corner, took</line>
        <line>a quiet, and, by sympathy, a boozy kind of pleasure in the customary</line>
        <line>life that was going forward. The saloon was fitted up with a good deal</line>
        <line>of taste. There were pictures on the walls, and among them an</line>
        <line>oil-painting of a beefsteak, with such an admirable show of juicy</line>
        <line>tenderness, that the beholder sighed to think it merely visionary, and</line>
        <line>incapable of ever being put upon a gridiron. Another work of high art</line>
        <line>was the lifelike representation of a noble sirloin; another, the</line>
        <line>hindquarters of a deer, retaining the hoofs and tawny fur; another, the</line>
        <line>head and shoulders of a salmon; and, still more exquisitely finished, a</line>
        <line>brace of canvasback ducks, in which the mottled feathers were depicted</line>
        <line>with the accuracy of a daguerreotype. Some very hungry painter, I</line>
        <line>suppose, had wrought these subjects of still-life, heightening his</line>
        <line>imagination with his appetite, and earning, it is to be hoped, the</line>
        <line>privilege of a daily dinner off whichever of his pictorial viands he</line>
        <line>liked best.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Then there was a fine old cheese, in which you could almost discern the</line>
        <line>mites; and some sardines, on a small plate, very richly done, and</line>
        <line>looking as if oozy with the oil in which they had been smothered. All</line>
        <line>these things were so perfectly imitated, that you seemed to have the</line>
        <line>genuine article before you, and yet with an indescribable, ideal charm;</line>
        <line>it took away the grossness from what was fleshiest and fattest, and</line>
        <line>thus helped the life of man, even in its earthliest relations, to</line>
        <line>appear rich and noble, as well as warm, cheerful, and substantial.</line>
        <line>There were pictures, too, of gallant revellers, those of the old time,</line>
        <line>Flemish, apparently, with doublets and slashed sleeves, drinking their</line>
        <line>wine out of fantastic, long-stemmed glasses; quaffing joyously,</line>
        <line>quaffing forever, with inaudible laughter and song; while the champagne</line>
        <line>bubbled immortally against their moustaches, or the purple tide of</line>
        <line>Burgundy ran inexhaustibly down their throats.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But, in an obscure corner of the saloon, there was a little Picture</line>
        <line>excellently done, moreover of a ragged, bloated, New England toper,</line>
        <line>stretched out on a bench, in the heavy, apoplectic sleep of</line>
        <line>drunkenness. The death-in-life was too well portrayed. You smelt the</line>
        <line>fumy liquor that had brought on this syncope. Your only comfort lay in</line>
        <line>the forced reflection, that, real as he looked, the poor caitiff was</line>
        <line>but imaginary, a bit of painted canvass, whom no delirium tremens, nor</line>
        <line>so much as a retributive headache, awaited, on the morrow.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>By this time, it being past eleven o'clock, the two bar-keepers of the</line>
        <line>saloon were in pretty constant activity. One of these young men had a</line>
        <line>rare faculty in the concoction of gin-cocktails. It was a spectacle to</line>
        <line>behold, how, with a tumbler in each hand, he tossed the contents from</line>
        <line>one to the other. Never conveying it awry, nor spilling the least</line>
        <line>drop, he compelled the frothy liquor, as it seemed to me, to spout</line>
        <line>forth from one glass and descend into the other, in a great parabolic</line>
        <line>curve, as well-defined and calculable as a planet's orbit. He had a</line>
        <line>good forehead, with a particularly large development just above the</line>
        <line>eyebrows; fine intellectual gifts, no doubt, which he had educated to</line>
        <line>this profitable end; being famous for nothing but gin-cocktails, and</line>
        <line>commanding a fair salary by his one accomplishment. These cocktails,</line>
        <line>and other artificial combinations of liquor, (of which there were at</line>
        <line>least a score, though mostly, I suspect, fantastic in their</line>
        <line>differences,) were much in favor with the younger class of customers,</line>
        <line>who, at farthest, had only reached the second stage of potatory life.</line>
        <line>The staunch, old soakers, on the other hand men who, if put on tap,</line>
        <line>would have yielded a red alcoholic liquor, by way of blood usually</line>
        <line>confined themselves to plain brandy-and-water, gin, or West India rum;</line>
        <line>and, oftentimes, they prefaced their dram with some medicinal remark as</line>
        <line>to the wholesomeness and stomachic qualities of that particular drink.</line>
        <line>Two or three appeared to have bottles of their own behind the counter;</line>
        <line>and, winking one red eye to the bar-keeper, he forthwith produced these</line>
        <line>choicest and peculiar cordials, which it was a matter of great interest</line>
        <line>and favor, among their acquaintances, to obtain a sip of.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Agreeably to the Yankee habit, under whatever circumstances, the</line>
        <line>deportment of all these good fellows, old or young, was decorous and</line>
        <line>thoroughly correct. They grew only the more sober in their cups; there</line>
        <line>was no confused babble nor boisterous laughter. They sucked in the</line>
        <line>joyous fire of the decanters and kept it smouldering in their inmost</line>
        <line>recesses, with a bliss known only to the heart which it warmed and</line>
        <line>comforted. Their eyes twinkled a little, to be sure; they hemmed</line>
        <line>vigorously after each glass, and laid a hand upon the pit of the</line>
        <line>stomach, as if the pleasant titillation there was what constituted the</line>
        <line>tangible part of their enjoyment. In that spot, unquestionably, and</line>
        <line>not in the brain, was the acme of the whole affair. But the true</line>
        <line>purpose of their drinking--and one that will induce men to drink, or do</line>
        <line>something equivalent, as long as this weary world shall endure--was the</line>
        <line>renewed youth and vigor, the brisk, cheerful sense of things present</line>
        <line>and to come, with which, for about a quarter of an hour, the dram</line>
        <line>permeated their systems. And when such quarters of an hour can be</line>
        <line>obtained in some mode less baneful to the great sum of a man's</line>
        <line>life,--but, nevertheless, with a little spice of impropriety, to give</line>
        <line>it a wild flavor,--we temperance people may ring out our bells for</line>
        <line>victory!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The prettiest object in the saloon was a tiny fountain, which threw up</line>
        <line>its feathery jet through the counter, and sparkled down again into an</line>
        <line>oval basin, or lakelet, containing several goldfishes. There was a bed</line>
        <line>of bright sand at the bottom, strewn with coral and rock-work; and the</line>
        <line>fishes went gleaming about, now turning up the sheen of a golden side,</line>
        <line>and now vanishing into the shadows of the water, like the fanciful</line>
        <line>thoughts that coquet with a poet in his dream. Never before, I</line>
        <line>imagine, did a company of water-drinkers remain so entirely</line>
        <line>uncontaminated by the bad example around them; nor could I help</line>
        <line>wondering that it had not occurred to any freakish inebriate to empty a</line>
        <line>glass of liquor into their lakelet. What a delightful idea! Who would</line>
        <line>not be a fish, if he could inhale jollity with the essential element of</line>
        <line>his existence!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I had begun to despair of meeting old Moodie, when, all at once, I</line>
        <line>recognized his hand and arm protruding from behind a screen that was</line>
        <line>set up for the accommodation of bashful topers. As a matter of course,</line>
        <line>he had one of Priscilla's little purses, and was quietly insinuating it</line>
        <line>under the notice of a person who stood near. This was always old</line>
        <line>Moodie's way. You hardly ever saw him advancing towards you, but</line>
        <line>became aware of his proximity without being able to guess how he had</line>
        <line>come thither. He glided about like a spirit, assuming visibility close</line>
        <line>to your elbow, offering his petty trifles of merchandise, remaining</line>
        <line>long enough for you to purchase, if so disposed, and then taking</line>
        <line>himself off, between two breaths, while you happened to be thinking of</line>
        <line>something else.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>By a sort of sympathetic impulse that often controlled me in those more</line>
        <line>impressible days of my life, I was induced to approach this old man in</line>
        <line>a mode as undemonstrative as his own. Thus, when, according to his</line>
        <line>custom, he was probably just about to vanish, he found me at his elbow.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah!" said he, with more emphasis than was usual with him. "It is Mr.</line>
        <line>Coverdale!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Yes, Mr. Moodie, your old acquaintance," answered "It is some time</line>
        <line>now since we ate luncheon together at Blithedale, and a good deal</line>
        <line>longer since our little talk together at the street corner."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"That was a good while ago," said the old man.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And he seemed inclined to say not a word more. His existence looked so</line>
        <line>colorless and torpid,--so very faintly shadowed on the canvas of</line>
        <line>reality,--that I was half afraid lest he should altogether disappear,</line>
        <line>even while my eyes were fixed full upon his figure. He was certainly</line>
        <line>the wretchedest old ghost in the world, with his crazy hat, the dingy</line>
        <line>handkerchief about his throat, his suit of threadbare gray, and</line>
        <line>especially that patch over his right eye, behind which he always seemed</line>
        <line>to be hiding himself. There was one method, however, of bringing him</line>
        <line>out into somewhat stronger relief. A glass of brandy would effect it.</line>
        <line>Perhaps the gentler influence of a bottle of claret might do the same.</line>
        <line>Nor could I think it a matter for the recording angel to write down</line>
        <line>against me, if--with my painful consciousness of the frost in this old</line>
        <line>man's blood, and the positive ice that had congealed about his heart--I</line>
        <line>should thaw him out, were it only for an hour, with the summer warmth</line>
        <line>of a little wine. What else could possibly be done for him? How else</line>
        <line>could he be imbued with energy enough to hope for a happier state</line>
        <line>hereafter? How else be inspired to say his prayers? For there are</line>
        <line>states of our spiritual system when the throb of the soul's life is too</line>
        <line>faint and weak to render us capable of religious aspiration.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Mr. Moodie," said I, "shall we lunch together? And would you like to</line>
        <line>drink a glass of wine?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>His one eye gleamed. He bowed; and it impressed me that he grew to be</line>
        <line>more of a man at once, either in anticipation of the wine, or as a</line>
        <line>grateful response to my good fellowship in offering it.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"With pleasure," he replied.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The bar-keeper, at my request, showed us into a private room, and soon</line>
        <line>afterwards set some fried oysters and a bottle of claret on the table;</line>
        <line>and I saw the old man glance curiously at the label of the bottle, as</line>
        <line>if to learn the brand.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It should be good wine," I remarked, "if it have any right to its</line>
        <line>label."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You cannot suppose, sir," said Moodie, with a sigh, "that a poor old</line>
        <line>fellow like me knows any difference in wines."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And yet, in his way of handling the glass, in his preliminary snuff at</line>
        <line>the aroma, in his first cautious sip of the wine, and the gustatory</line>
        <line>skill with which he gave his palate the full advantage of it, it was</line>
        <line>impossible not to recognize the connoisseur.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I fancy, Mr. Moodie," said I, "you are a much better judge of wines</line>
        <line>than I have yet learned to be. Tell me fairly,--did you never drink it</line>
        <line>where the grape grows?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"How should that have been, Mr. Coverdale?" answered old Moodie shyly;</line>
        <line>but then he took courage, as it were, and uttered a feeble little</line>
        <line>laugh. "The flavor of this wine," added he, "and its perfume still</line>
        <line>more than its taste, makes me remember that I was once a young man."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I wish, Mr. Moodie," suggested I,--not that I greatly cared about it,</line>
        <line>however, but was only anxious to draw him into some talk about</line>
        <line>Priscilla and Zenobia,--"I wish, while we sit over our wine, you would</line>
        <line>favor me with a few of those youthful reminiscences."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah," said he, shaking his head, "they might interest you more than you</line>
        <line>suppose. But I had better be silent, Mr. Coverdale. If this good</line>
        <line>wine,--though claret, I suppose, is not apt to play such a trick,--but</line>
        <line>if it should make my tongue run too freely, I could never look you in</line>
        <line>the face again."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You never did look me in the face, Mr. Moodie," I replied, "until this</line>
        <line>very moment."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah!" sighed old Moodie.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It was wonderful, however, what an effect the mild grape-juice wrought</line>
        <line>upon him. It was not in the wine, but in the associations which it</line>
        <line>seemed to bring up. Instead of the mean, slouching, furtive, painfully</line>
        <line>depressed air of an old city vagabond, more like a gray kennel-rat than</line>
        <line>any other living thing, he began to take the aspect of a decayed</line>
        <line>gentleman. Even his garments--especially after I had myself quaffed a</line>
        <line>glass or two--looked less shabby than when we first sat down. There</line>
        <line>was, by and by, a certain exuberance and elaborateness of gesture and</line>
        <line>manner, oddly in contrast with all that I had hitherto seen of him.</line>
        <line>Anon, with hardly any impulse from me, old Moodie began to talk. His</line>
        <line>communications referred exclusively to a long-past and more fortunate</line>
        <line>period of his life, with only a few unavoidable allusions to the</line>
        <line>circumstances that had reduced him to his present state. But, having</line>
        <line>once got the clew, my subsequent researches acquainted me with the main</line>
        <line>facts of the following narrative; although, in writing it out, my pen</line>
        <line>has perhaps allowed itself a trifle of romantic and legendary license,</line>
        <line>worthier of a small poet than of a grave biographer.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>FAUNTLEROY</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Five-and-twenty years ago, at the epoch of this story, there dwelt in</line>
        <line>one of the Middle States a man whom we shall call Fauntleroy; a man of</line>
        <line>wealth, and magnificent tastes, and prodigal expenditure. His home</line>
        <line>might almost be styled a palace; his habits, in the ordinary sense,</line>
        <line>princely. His whole being seemed to have crystallized itself into an</line>
        <line>external splendor, wherewith he glittered in the eyes of the world, and</line>
        <line>had no other life than upon this gaudy surface. He had married a</line>
        <line>lovely woman, whose nature was deeper than his own. But his affection</line>
        <line>for her, though it showed largely, was superficial, like all his other</line>
        <line>manifestations and developments; he did not so truly keep this noble</line>
        <line>creature in his heart, as wear her beauty for the most brilliant</line>
        <line>ornament of his outward state. And there was born to him a child, a</line>
        <line>beautiful daughter, whom he took from the beneficent hand of God with</line>
        <line>no just sense of her immortal value, but as a man already rich in gems</line>
        <line>would receive another jewel. If he loved her, it was because she shone.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>After Fauntleroy had thus spent a few empty years, coruscating</line>
        <line>continually an unnatural light, the source of it--which was merely his</line>
        <line>gold--began to grow more shallow, and finally became exhausted. He saw</line>
        <line>himself in imminent peril of losing all that had heretofore</line>
        <line>distinguished him; and, conscious of no innate worth to fall back upon,</line>
        <line>he recoiled from this calamity with the instinct of a soul shrinking</line>
        <line>from annihilation. To avoid it,--wretched man!--or rather to defer it,</line>
        <line>if but for a month, a day, or only to procure himself the life of a few</line>
        <line>breaths more amid the false glitter which was now less his own than</line>
        <line>ever,--he made himself guilty of a crime. It was just the sort of</line>
        <line>crime, growing out of its artificial state, which society (unless it</line>
        <line>should change its entire constitution for this man's unworthy sake)</line>
        <line>neither could nor ought to pardon. More safely might it pardon murder.</line>
        <line>Fauntleroy's guilt was discovered. He fled; his wife perished, by the</line>
        <line>necessity of her innate nobleness, in its alliance with a being so</line>
        <line>ignoble; and betwixt her mother's death and her father's ignominy, his</line>
        <line>daughter was left worse than orphaned.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>There was no pursuit after Fauntleroy. His family connections, who had</line>
        <line>great wealth, made such arrangements with those whom he had attempted</line>
        <line>to wrong as secured him from the retribution that would have overtaken</line>
        <line>an unfriended criminal. The wreck of his estate was divided among his</line>
        <line>creditors: His name, in a very brief space, was forgotten by the</line>
        <line>multitude who had passed it so diligently from mouth to mouth. Seldom,</line>
        <line>indeed, was it recalled, even by his closest former intimates. Nor</line>
        <line>could it have been otherwise. The man had laid no real touch on any</line>
        <line>mortal's heart. Being a mere image, an optical delusion, created by</line>
        <line>the sunshine of prosperity, it was his law to vanish into the shadow of</line>
        <line>the first intervening cloud. He seemed to leave no vacancy; a</line>
        <line>phenomenon which, like many others that attended his brief career, went</line>
        <line>far to prove the illusiveness of his existence.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Not, however, that the physical substance of Fauntleroy had literally</line>
        <line>melted into vapor. He had fled northward to the New England</line>
        <line>metropolis, and had taken up his abode, under another name, in a</line>
        <line>squalid street or court of the older portion of the city. There he</line>
        <line>dwelt among poverty-stricken wretches, sinners, and forlorn good</line>
        <line>people, Irish, and whomsoever else were neediest. Many families were</line>
        <line>clustered in each house together, above stairs and below, in the little</line>
        <line>peaked garrets, and even in the dusky cellars. The house where</line>
        <line>Fauntleroy paid weekly rent for a chamber and a closet had been a</line>
        <line>stately habitation in its day. An old colonial governor had built it,</line>
        <line>and lived there, long ago, and held his levees in a great room where</line>
        <line>now slept twenty Irish bedfellows; and died in Fauntleroy's chamber,</line>
        <line>which his embroidered and white-wigged ghost still haunted. Tattered</line>
        <line>hangings, a marble hearth, traversed with many cracks and fissures, a</line>
        <line>richly carved oaken mantelpiece, partly hacked away for kindling-stuff,</line>
        <line>a stuccoed ceiling, defaced with great, unsightly patches of the naked</line>
        <line>laths,--such was the chamber's aspect, as if, with its splinters and</line>
        <line>rags of dirty splendor, it were a kind of practical gibe at this poor,</line>
        <line>ruined man of show.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>At first, and at irregular intervals, his relatives allowed Fauntleroy</line>
        <line>a little pittance to sustain life; not from any love, perhaps, but lest</line>
        <line>poverty should compel him, by new offences, to add more shame to that</line>
        <line>with which he had already stained them. But he showed no tendency to</line>
        <line>further guilt. His character appeared to have been radically changed</line>
        <line>(as, indeed, from its shallowness, it well might) by his miserable</line>
        <line>fate; or, it may be, the traits now seen in him were portions of the</line>
        <line>same character, presenting itself in another phase. Instead of any</line>
        <line>longer seeking to live in the sight of the world, his impulse was to</line>
        <line>shrink into the nearest obscurity, and to be unseen of men, were it</line>
        <line>possible, even while standing before their eyes. He had no pride; it</line>
        <line>was all trodden in the dust. No ostentation; for how could it survive,</line>
        <line>when there was nothing left of Fauntleroy, save penury and shame! His</line>
        <line>very gait demonstrated that he would gladly have faded out of view, and</line>
        <line>have crept about invisibly, for the sake of sheltering himself from the</line>
        <line>irksomeness of a human glance. Hardly, it was averred, within the</line>
        <line>memory of those who knew him now, had he the hardihood to show his full</line>
        <line>front to the world. He skulked in corners, and crept about in a sort</line>
        <line>of noonday twilight, making himself gray and misty, at all hours, with</line>
        <line>his morbid intolerance of sunshine.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>In his torpid despair, however, he had done an act which that condition</line>
        <line>of the spirit seems to prompt almost as often as prosperity and hope.</line>
        <line>Fauntleroy was again married. He had taken to wife a forlorn,</line>
        <line>meek-spirited, feeble young woman, a seamstress, whom he found dwelling</line>
        <line>with her mother in a contiguous chamber of the old gubernatorial</line>
        <line>residence. This poor phantom--as the beautiful and noble companion of</line>
        <line>his former life had done brought him a daughter. And sometimes, as from</line>
        <line>one dream into another, Fauntleroy looked forth out of his present</line>
        <line>grimy environment into that past magnificence, and wondered whether the</line>
        <line>grandee of yesterday or the pauper of to-day were real. But, in my</line>
        <line>mind, the one and the other were alike impalpable. In truth, it was</line>
        <line>Fauntleroy's fatality to behold whatever he touched dissolve. After a</line>
        <line>few years, his second wife (dim shadow that she had always been) faded</line>
        <line>finally out of the world, and left Fauntleroy to deal as he might with</line>
        <line>their pale and nervous child. And, by this time, among his distant</line>
        <line>relatives,--with whom he had grown a weary thought, linked with</line>
        <line>contagious infamy, and which they were only too willing to get rid</line>
        <line>of,--he was himself supposed to be no more.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The younger child, like his elder one, might be considered as the true</line>
        <line>offspring of both parents, and as the reflection of their state. She</line>
        <line>was a tremulous little creature, shrinking involuntarily from all</line>
        <line>mankind, but in timidity, and no sour repugnance. There was a lack of</line>
        <line>human substance in her; it seemed as if, were she to stand up in a</line>
        <line>sunbeam, it would pass right through her figure, and trace out the</line>
        <line>cracked and dusty window-panes upon the naked floor. But,</line>
        <line>nevertheless, the poor child had a heart; and from her mother's gentle</line>
        <line>character she had inherited a profound and still capacity of affection.</line>
        <line>And so her life was one of love. She bestowed it partly on her father,</line>
        <line>but in greater part on an idea.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>For Fauntleroy, as they sat by their cheerless fireside,--which was no</line>
        <line>fireside, in truth, but only a rusty stove,--had often talked to the</line>
        <line>little girl about his former wealth, the noble loveliness of his first</line>
        <line>wife, and the beautiful child whom she had given him. Instead of the</line>
        <line>fairy tales which other parents tell, he told Priscilla this. And, out</line>
        <line>of the loneliness of her sad little existence, Priscilla's love grew,</line>
        <line>and tended upward, and twined itself perseveringly around this unseen</line>
        <line>sister; as a grapevine might strive to clamber out of a gloomy hollow</line>
        <line>among the rocks, and embrace a young tree standing in the sunny warmth</line>
        <line>above. It was almost like worship, both in its earnestness and its</line>
        <line>humility; nor was it the less humble--though the more earnest--because</line>
        <line>Priscilla could claim human kindred with the being whom she, so</line>
        <line>devoutly loved. As with worship, too, it gave her soul the refreshment</line>
        <line>of a purer atmosphere. Save for this singular, this melancholy, and</line>
        <line>yet beautiful affection, the child could hardly have lived; or, had she</line>
        <line>lived, with a heart shrunken for lack of any sentiment to fill it, she</line>
        <line>must have yielded to the barren miseries of her position, and have</line>
        <line>grown to womanhood characterless and worthless. But now, amid all the</line>
        <line>sombre coarseness of her father's outward life, and of her own,</line>
        <line>Priscilla had a higher and imaginative life within. Some faint gleam</line>
        <line>thereof was often visible upon her face. It was as if, in her spiritual</line>
        <line>visits to her brilliant sister, a portion of the latter's brightness</line>
        <line>had permeated our dim Priscilla, and still lingered, shedding a faint</line>
        <line>illumination through the cheerless chamber, after she came back.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As the child grew up, so pallid and so slender, and with much</line>
        <line>unaccountable nervousness, and all the weaknesses of neglected infancy</line>
        <line>still haunting her, the gross and simple neighbors whispered strange</line>
        <line>things about Priscilla. The big, red, Irish matrons, whose innumerable</line>
        <line>progeny swarmed out of the adjacent doors, used to mock at the pale</line>
        <line>Western child. They fancied--or, at least, affirmed it, between jest</line>
        <line>and earnest--that she was not so solid flesh and blood as other</line>
        <line>children, but mixed largely with a thinner element. They called her</line>
        <line>ghost-child, and said that she could indeed vanish when she pleased,</line>
        <line>but could never, in her densest moments, make herself quite visible.</line>
        <line>The sun at midday would shine through her; in the first gray of the</line>
        <line>twilight, she lost all the distinctness of her outline; and, if you</line>
        <line>followed the dim thing into a dark corner, behold! she was not there.</line>
        <line>And it was true that Priscilla had strange ways; strange ways, and</line>
        <line>stranger words, when she uttered any words at all. Never stirring out</line>
        <line>of the old governor's dusky house, she sometimes talked of distant</line>
        <line>places and splendid rooms, as if she had just left them. Hidden things</line>
        <line>were visible to her (at least so the people inferred from obscure hints</line>
        <line>escaping unawares out of her mouth), and silence was audible. And in</line>
        <line>all the world there was nothing so difficult to be endured, by those</line>
        <line>who had any dark secret to conceal, as the glance of Priscilla's timid</line>
        <line>and melancholy eyes.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Her peculiarities were the theme of continual gossip among the other</line>
        <line>inhabitants of the gubernatorial mansion. The rumor spread thence into</line>
        <line>a wider circle. Those who knew old Moodie, as he was now called, used</line>
        <line>often to jeer him, at the very street-corners, about his daughter's</line>
        <line>gift of second-sight and prophecy. It was a period when science</line>
        <line>(though mostly through its empirical professors) was bringing forward,</line>
        <line>anew, a hoard of facts and imperfect theories, that had partially won</line>
        <line>credence in elder times, but which modern scepticism had swept away as</line>
        <line>rubbish. These things were now tossed up again, out of the surging</line>
        <line>ocean of human thought and experience. The story of Priscilla's</line>
        <line>preternatural manifestations, therefore, attracted a kind of notice of</line>
        <line>which it would have been deemed wholly unworthy a few years earlier.</line>
        <line>One day a gentleman ascended the creaking staircase, and inquired which</line>
        <line>was old Moodie's chamber door. And, several times, he came again. He</line>
        <line>was a marvellously handsome man,--still youthful, too, and fashionably</line>
        <line>dressed. Except that Priscilla, in those days, had no beauty, and, in</line>
        <line>the languor of her existence, had not yet blossomed into womanhood,</line>
        <line>there would have been rich food for scandal in these visits; for the</line>
        <line>girl was unquestionably their sole object, although her father was</line>
        <line>supposed always to be present. But, it must likewise be added, there</line>
        <line>was something about Priscilla that calumny could not meddle with; and</line>
        <line>thus far was she privileged, either by the preponderance of what was</line>
        <line>spiritual, or the thin and watery blood that left her cheek so pallid.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Yet, if the busy tongues of the neighborhood spared Priscilla in one</line>
        <line>way, they made themselves amends by renewed and wilder babble on</line>
        <line>another score. They averred that the strange gentleman was a wizard,</line>
        <line>and that he had taken advantage of Priscilla's lack of earthly</line>
        <line>substance to subject her to himself, as his familiar spirit, through</line>
        <line>whose medium he gained cognizance of whatever happened, in regions near</line>
        <line>or remote. The boundaries of his power were defined by the verge of</line>
        <line>the pit of Tartarus on the one hand, and the third sphere of the</line>
        <line>celestial world on the other. Again, they declared their suspicion</line>
        <line>that the wizard, with all his show of manly beauty, was really an aged</line>
        <line>and wizened figure, or else that his semblance of a human body was only</line>
        <line>a necromantic, or perhaps a mechanical contrivance, in which a demon</line>
        <line>walked about. In proof of it, however, they could merely instance a</line>
        <line>gold band around his upper teeth, which had once been visible to</line>
        <line>several old women, when he smiled at them from the top of the</line>
        <line>governor's staircase. Of course this was all absurdity, or mostly so.</line>
        <line>But, after every possible deduction, there remained certain very</line>
        <line>mysterious points about the stranger's character, as well as the</line>
        <line>connection that he established with Priscilla. Its nature at that</line>
        <line>period was even less understood than now, when miracles of this kind</line>
        <line>have grown so absolutely stale, that I would gladly, if the truth</line>
        <line>allowed, dismiss the whole matter from my narrative.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>We must now glance backward, in quest of the beautiful daughter of</line>
        <line>Fauntleroy's prosperity. What had become of her? Fauntleroy's only</line>
        <line>brother, a bachelor, and with no other relative so near, had adopted</line>
        <line>the forsaken child. She grew up in affluence, with native graces</line>
        <line>clustering luxuriantly about her. In her triumphant progress towards</line>
        <line>womanhood, she was adorned with every variety of feminine</line>
        <line>accomplishment. But she lacked a mother's care. With no adequate</line>
        <line>control, on any hand (for a man, however stern, however wise, can never</line>
        <line>sway and guide a female child), her character was left to shape itself.</line>
        <line>There was good in it, and evil. Passionate, self-willed, and</line>
        <line>imperious, she had a warm and generous nature; showing the richness of</line>
        <line>the soil, however, chiefly by the weeds that flourished in it, and</line>
        <line>choked up the herbs of grace. In her girlhood her uncle died. As</line>
        <line>Fauntleroy was supposed to be likewise dead, and no other heir was</line>
        <line>known to exist, his wealth devolved on her, although, dying suddenly,</line>
        <line>the uncle left no will. After his death there were obscure passages in</line>
        <line>Zenobia's history. There were whispers of an attachment, and even a</line>
        <line>secret marriage, with a fascinating and accomplished but unprincipled</line>
        <line>young man. The incidents and appearances, however, which led to this</line>
        <line>surmise soon passed away, and were forgotten.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Nor was her reputation seriously affected by the report. In fact, so</line>
        <line>great was her native power and influence, and such seemed the careless</line>
        <line>purity of her nature, that whatever Zenobia did was generally</line>
        <line>acknowledged as right for her to do. The world never criticised her so</line>
        <line>harshly as it does most women who transcend its rules. It almost</line>
        <line>yielded its assent, when it beheld her stepping out of the common path,</line>
        <line>and asserting the more extensive privileges of her sex, both</line>
        <line>theoretically and by her practice. The sphere of ordinary womanhood</line>
        <line>was felt to be narrower than her development required.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>A portion of Zenobia's more recent life is told in the foregoing pages.</line>
        <line>Partly in earnest,--and, I imagine, as was her disposition, half in a</line>
        <line>proud jest, or in a kind of recklessness that had grown upon her, out</line>
        <line>of some hidden grief,--she had given her countenance, and promised</line>
        <line>liberal pecuniary aid, to our experiment of a better social state. And</line>
        <line>Priscilla followed her to Blithedale. The sole bliss of her life had</line>
        <line>been a dream of this beautiful sister, who had never so much as known</line>
        <line>of her existence. By this time, too, the poor girl was enthralled in</line>
        <line>an intolerable bondage, from which she must either free herself or</line>
        <line>perish. She deemed herself safest near Zenobia, into whose large heart</line>
        <line>she hoped to nestle.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>One evening, months after Priscilla's departure, when Moodie (or shall</line>
        <line>we call him Fauntleroy?) was sitting alone in the state-chamber of the</line>
        <line>old governor, there came footsteps up the staircase. There was a pause</line>
        <line>on the landing-place. A lady's musical yet haughty accents were heard</line>
        <line>making an inquiry from some denizen of the house, who had thrust a head</line>
        <line>out of a contiguous chamber. There was then a knock at Moodie's door.</line>
        <line>"Come in!" said he.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And Zenobia entered. The details of the interview that followed being</line>
        <line>unknown to me,--while, notwithstanding, it would be a pity quite to</line>
        <line>lose the picturesqueness of the situation,--I shall attempt to sketch</line>
        <line>it, mainly from fancy, although with some general grounds of surmise in</line>
        <line>regard to the old man's feelings.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She gazed wonderingly at the dismal chamber. Dismal to her, who beheld</line>
        <line>it only for an instant; and how much more so to him, into whose brain</line>
        <line>each bare spot on the ceiling, every tatter of the paper-hangings, and</line>
        <line>all the splintered carvings of the mantelpiece, seen wearily through</line>
        <line>long years, had worn their several prints! Inexpressibly miserable is</line>
        <line>this familiarity with objects that have been from the first disgustful.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I have received a strange message," said Zenobia, after a moment's</line>
        <line>silence, "requesting, or rather enjoining it upon me, to come hither.</line>
        <line>Rather from curiosity than any other motive,--and because, though a</line>
        <line>woman, I have not all the timidity of one,--I have complied. Can it be</line>
        <line>you, sir, who thus summoned me?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It was," answered Moodie.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And what was your purpose?" she continued. "You require charity,</line>
        <line>perhaps? In that case, the message might have been more fitly worded.</line>
        <line>But you are old and poor, and age and poverty should be allowed their</line>
        <line>privileges. Tell me, therefore, to what extent you need my aid."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Put up your purse," said the supposed mendicant, with an inexplicable</line>
        <line>smile. "Keep it,--keep all your wealth,--until I demand it all, or</line>
        <line>none! My message had no such end in view. You are beautiful, they</line>
        <line>tell me; and I desired to look at you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>He took the one lamp that showed the discomfort and sordidness of his</line>
        <line>abode, and approaching Zenobia held it up, so as to gain the more</line>
        <line>perfect view of her, from top to toe. So obscure was the chamber, that</line>
        <line>you could see the reflection of her diamonds thrown upon the dingy</line>
        <line>wall, and flickering with the rise and fall of Zenobia's breath. It was</line>
        <line>the splendor of those jewels on her neck, like lamps that burn before</line>
        <line>some fair temple, and the jewelled flower in her hair, more than the</line>
        <line>murky, yellow light, that helped him to see her beauty. But he beheld</line>
        <line>it, and grew proud at heart; his own figure, in spite of his mean</line>
        <line>habiliments, assumed an air of state and grandeur.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It is well," cried old Moodie. "Keep your wealth. You are right</line>
        <line>worthy of it. Keep it, therefore, but with one condition only."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia thought the old man beside himself, and was moved with pity.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Have you none to care for you?" asked she. "No daughter?--no</line>
        <line>kind-hearted neighbor?--no means of procuring the attendance which you</line>
        <line>need? Tell me once again, can I do nothing for you?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Nothing," he replied. "I have beheld what I wished. Now leave me.</line>
        <line>Linger not a moment longer, or I may be tempted to say what would bring</line>
        <line>a cloud over that queenly brow. Keep all your wealth, but with only</line>
        <line>this one condition: Be kind--be no less kind than sisters are--to my</line>
        <line>poor Priscilla!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And, it may be, after Zenobia withdrew, Fauntleroy paced his gloomy</line>
        <line>chamber, and communed with himself as follows,--or, at all events, it</line>
        <line>is the only solution which I can offer of the enigma presented in his</line>
        <line>character:--"I am unchanged,--the same man as of yore!" said he. "True,</line>
        <line>my brother's wealth--he dying intestate--is legally my own. I know it;</line>
        <line>yet of my own choice, I live a beggar, and go meanly clad, and hide</line>
        <line>myself behind a forgotten ignominy. Looks this like ostentation? Ah!</line>
        <line>but in Zenobia I live again! Beholding her, so beautiful,--so fit to</line>
        <line>be adorned with all imaginable splendor of outward state,--the cursed</line>
        <line>vanity, which, half a lifetime since, dropt off like tatters of once</line>
        <line>gaudy apparel from my debased and ruined person, is all renewed for her</line>
        <line>sake. Were I to reappear, my shame would go with me from darkness into</line>
        <line>daylight. Zenobia has the splendor, and not the shame. Let the world</line>
        <line>admire her, and be dazzled by her, the brilliant child of my</line>
        <line>prosperity! It is Fauntleroy that still shines through her!" But</line>
        <line>then, perhaps, another thought occurred to him.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"My poor Priscilla! And am I just to her, in surrendering all to this</line>
        <line>beautiful Zenobia? Priscilla! I love her best,--I love her only!--but</line>
        <line>with shame, not pride. So dim, so pallid, so shrinking,--the daughter</line>
        <line>of my long calamity! Wealth were but a mockery in Priscilla's hands.</line>
        <line>What is its use, except to fling a golden radiance around those who</line>
        <line>grasp it? Yet let Zenobia take heed! Priscilla shall have no wrong!"</line>
        <line>But, while the man of show thus meditated,--that very evening, so far</line>
        <line>as I can adjust the dates of these strange incidents,--Priscilla poor,</line>
        <line>pallid flower!--was either snatched from Zenobia's hand, or flung</line>
        <line>wilfully away!</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>A VILLAGE HALL</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Well, I betook myself away, and wandered up and down, like an exorcised</line>
        <line>spirit that had been driven from its old haunts after a mighty</line>
        <line>struggle. It takes down the solitary pride of man, beyond most other</line>
        <line>things, to find the impracticability of flinging aside affections that</line>
        <line>have grown irksome. The bands that were silken once are apt to become</line>
        <line>iron fetters when we desire to shake them off. Our souls, after all,</line>
        <line>are not our own. We convey a property in them to those with whom we</line>
        <line>associate; but to what extent can never be known, until we feel the</line>
        <line>tug, the agony, of our abortive effort to resume an exclusive sway over</line>
        <line>ourselves. Thus, in all the weeks of my absence, my thoughts</line>
        <line>continually reverted back, brooding over the bygone months, and</line>
        <line>bringing up incidents that seemed hardly to have left a trace of</line>
        <line>themselves in their passage. I spent painful hours in recalling these</line>
        <line>trifles, and rendering them more misty and unsubstantial than at first</line>
        <line>by the quantity of speculative musing thus kneaded in with them.</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla! These three had absorbed my life</line>
        <line>into themselves. Together with an inexpressible longing to know their</line>
        <line>fortunes, there was likewise a morbid resentment of my own pain, and a</line>
        <line>stubborn reluctance to come again within their sphere.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>All that I learned of them, therefore, was comprised in a few brief and</line>
        <line>pungent squibs, such as the newspapers were then in the habit of</line>
        <line>bestowing on our socialist enterprise. There was one paragraph, which</line>
        <line>if I rightly guessed its purport bore reference to Zenobia, but was too</line>
        <line>darkly hinted to convey even thus much of certainty. Hollingsworth,</line>
        <line>too, with his philanthropic project, afforded the penny-a-liners a</line>
        <line>theme for some savage and bloody minded jokes; and, considerably to my</line>
        <line>surprise, they affected me with as much indignation as if we had still</line>
        <line>been friends.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Thus passed several weeks; time long enough for my brown and</line>
        <line>toil-hardened hands to reaccustom themselves to gloves. Old habits,</line>
        <line>such as were merely external, returned upon me with wonderful</line>
        <line>promptitude. My superficial talk, too, assumed altogether a worldly</line>
        <line>tone. Meeting former acquaintances, who showed themselves inclined to</line>
        <line>ridicule my heroic devotion to the cause of human welfare, I spoke of</line>
        <line>the recent phase of my life as indeed fair matter for a jest. But, I</line>
        <line>also gave them to understand that it was, at most, only an experiment,</line>
        <line>on which I had staked no valuable amount of hope or fear. It had</line>
        <line>enabled me to pass the summer in a novel and agreeable way, had</line>
        <line>afforded me some grotesque specimens of artificial simplicity, and</line>
        <line>could not, therefore, so far as I was concerned, be reckoned a failure.</line>
        <line>In no one instance, however, did I voluntarily speak of my three</line>
        <line>friends. They dwelt in a profounder region. The more I consider</line>
        <line>myself as I then was, the more do I recognize how deeply my connection</line>
        <line>with those three had affected all my being.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As it was already the epoch of annihilated space, I might in the time I</line>
        <line>was away from Blithedale have snatched a glimpse at England, and been</line>
        <line>back again. But my wanderings were confined within a very limited</line>
        <line>sphere. I hopped and fluttered, like a bird with a string about its</line>
        <line>leg, gyrating round a small circumference, and keeping up a restless</line>
        <line>activity to no purpose. Thus it was still in our familiar</line>
        <line>Massachusetts--in one of its white country villages--that I must next</line>
        <line>particularize an incident.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The scene was one of those lyceum halls, of which almost every village</line>
        <line>has now its own, dedicated to that sober and pallid, or rather</line>
        <line>drab-colored, mode of winter-evening entertainment, the lecture. Of</line>
        <line>late years this has come strangely into vogue, when the natural</line>
        <line>tendency of things would seem to be to substitute lettered for oral</line>
        <line>methods of addressing the public. But, in halls like this, besides the</line>
        <line>winter course of lectures, there is a rich and varied series of other</line>
        <line>exhibitions. Hither comes the ventriloquist, with all his mysterious</line>
        <line>tongues; the thaumaturgist, too, with his miraculous transformations of</line>
        <line>plates, doves, and rings, his pancakes smoking in your hat, and his</line>
        <line>cellar of choice liquors represented in one small bottle. Here, also,</line>
        <line>the itinerant professor instructs separate classes of ladies and</line>
        <line>gentlemen in physiology, and demonstrates his lessons by the aid of</line>
        <line>real skeletons, and manikins in wax, from Paris. Here is to be heard</line>
        <line>the choir of Ethiopian melodists, and to be seen the diorama of Moscow</line>
        <line>or Bunker Hill, or the moving panorama of the Chinese wall. Here is</line>
        <line>displayed the museum of wax figures, illustrating the wide catholicism</line>
        <line>of earthly renown, by mixing up heroes and statesmen, the pope and the</line>
        <line>Mormon prophet, kings, queens, murderers, and beautiful ladies; every</line>
        <line>sort of person, in short, except authors, of whom I never beheld even</line>
        <line>the most famous done in wax. And here, in this many-purposed hall</line>
        <line>(unless the selectmen of the village chance to have more than their</line>
        <line>share of the Puritanism, which, however diversified with later</line>
        <line>patchwork, still gives its prevailing tint to New England</line>
        <line>character),--here the company of strolling players sets up its little</line>
        <line>stage, and claims patronage for the legitimate drama.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But, on the autumnal evening which I speak of, a number of printed</line>
        <line>handbills--stuck up in the bar-room, and on the sign-post of the hotel,</line>
        <line>and on the meeting-house porch, and distributed largely through the</line>
        <line>village--had promised the inhabitants an interview with that celebrated</line>
        <line>and hitherto inexplicable phenomenon, the Veiled Lady!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The hall was fitted up with an amphitheatrical descent of seats towards</line>
        <line>a platform, on which stood a desk, two lights, a stool, and a capacious</line>
        <line>antique chair. The audience was of a generally decent and respectable</line>
        <line>character: old farmers, in their Sunday black coats, with shrewd, hard,</line>
        <line>sun-dried faces, and a cynical humor, oftener than any other</line>
        <line>expression, in their eyes; pretty girls, in many-colored attire; pretty</line>
        <line>young men,--the schoolmaster, the lawyer, or student at law, the</line>
        <line>shop-keeper,--all looking rather suburban than rural. In these days,</line>
        <line>there is absolutely no rusticity, except when the actual labor of the</line>
        <line>soil leaves its earth-mould on the person. There was likewise a</line>
        <line>considerable proportion of young and middle-aged women, many of them</line>
        <line>stern in feature, with marked foreheads, and a very definite line of</line>
        <line>eyebrow; a type of womanhood in which a bold intellectual development</line>
        <line>seems to be keeping pace with the progressive delicacy of the physical</line>
        <line>constitution. Of all these people I took note, at first, according to</line>
        <line>my custom. But I ceased to do so the moment that my eyes fell on an</line>
        <line>individual who sat two or three seats below me, immovable, apparently</line>
        <line>deep in thought, with his back, of course, towards me, and his face</line>
        <line>turned steadfastly upon the platform.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>After sitting awhile in contemplation of this person's familiar</line>
        <line>contour, I was irresistibly moved to step over the intervening benches,</line>
        <line>lay my hand on his shoulder, put my mouth close to his ear, and address</line>
        <line>him in a sepulchral, melodramatic whisper: "Hollingsworth! where have</line>
        <line>you left Zenobia?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>His nerves, however, were proof against my attack. He turned half</line>
        <line>around, and looked me in the face with great sad eyes, in which there</line>
        <line>was neither kindness nor resentment, nor any perceptible surprise.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Zenobia, when I last saw her," he answered, "was at Blithedale."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>He said no more. But there was a great deal of talk going on near me,</line>
        <line>among a knot of people who might be considered as representing the</line>
        <line>mysticism, or rather the mystic sensuality, of this singular age. The</line>
        <line>nature of the exhibition that was about to take place had probably</line>
        <line>given the turn to their conversation.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I heard, from a pale man in blue spectacles, some stranger stories than</line>
        <line>ever were written in a romance; told, too, with a simple, unimaginative</line>
        <line>steadfastness, which was terribly efficacious in compelling the auditor</line>
        <line>to receive them into the category of established facts. He cited</line>
        <line>instances of the miraculous power of one human being over the will and</line>
        <line>passions of another; insomuch that settled grief was but a shadow</line>
        <line>beneath the influence of a man possessing this potency, and the strong</line>
        <line>love of years melted away like a vapor. At the bidding of one of these</line>
        <line>wizards, the maiden, with her lover's kiss still burning on her lips,</line>
        <line>would turn from him with icy indifference; the newly made widow would</line>
        <line>dig up her buried heart out of her young husband's grave before the</line>
        <line>sods had taken root upon it; a mother with her babe's milk in her bosom</line>
        <line>would thrust away her child. Human character was but soft wax in his</line>
        <line>hands; and guilt, or virtue, only the forms into which he should see</line>
        <line>fit to mould it. The religious sentiment was a flame which he could</line>
        <line>blow up with his breath, or a spark that he could utterly extinguish.</line>
        <line>It is unutterable, the horror and disgust with which I listened, and</line>
        <line>saw that, if these things were to be believed, the individual soul was</line>
        <line>virtually annihilated, and all that is sweet and pure in our present</line>
        <line>life debased, and that the idea of man's eternal responsibility was</line>
        <line>made ridiculous, and immortality rendered at once impossible, and not</line>
        <line>worth acceptance. But I would have perished on the spot sooner than</line>
        <line>believe it.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The epoch of rapping spirits, and all the wonders that have followed in</line>
        <line>their train,--such as tables upset by invisible agencies, bells</line>
        <line>self-tolled at funerals, and ghostly music performed on</line>
        <line>jew's-harps,--had not yet arrived. Alas, my countrymen, methinks we</line>
        <line>have fallen on an evil age! If these phenomena have not humbug at the</line>
        <line>bottom, so much the worse for us. What can they indicate, in a</line>
        <line>spiritual way, except that the soul of man is descending to a lower</line>
        <line>point than it has ever before reached while incarnate? We are pursuing</line>
        <line>a downward course in the eternal march, and thus bring ourselves into</line>
        <line>the same range with beings whom death, in requital of their gross and</line>
        <line>evil lives, has degraded below humanity! To hold intercourse with</line>
        <line>spirits of this order, we must stoop and grovel in some element more</line>
        <line>vile than earthly dust. These goblins, if they exist at all, are but</line>
        <line>the shadows of past mortality, outcasts, mere refuse stuff, adjudged</line>
        <line>unworthy of the eternal world, and, on the most favorable supposition,</line>
        <line>dwindling gradually into nothingness. The less we have to say to them</line>
        <line>the better, lest we share their fate!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The audience now began to be impatient; they signified their desire for</line>
        <line>the entertainment to commence by thump of sticks and stamp of</line>
        <line>boot-heels. Nor was it a great while longer before, in response to</line>
        <line>their call, there appeared a bearded personage in Oriental robes,</line>
        <line>looking like one of the enchanters of the Arabian Nights. He came upon</line>
        <line>the platform from a side door, saluted the spectators, not with a</line>
        <line>salaam, but a bow, took his station at the desk, and first blowing his</line>
        <line>nose with a white handkerchief, prepared to speak. The environment of</line>
        <line>the homely village hall, and the absence of many ingenious contrivances</line>
        <line>of stage effect with which the exhibition had heretofore been set off,</line>
        <line>seemed to bring the artifice of this character more openly upon the</line>
        <line>surface. No sooner did I behold the bearded enchanter, than, laying my</line>
        <line>hand again on Hollingsworth's shoulder, I whispered in his ear, "Do you</line>
        <line>know him?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I never saw the man before," he muttered, without turning his head.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But I had seen him three times already.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Once, on occasion of my first visit to the Veiled Lady; a second time,</line>
        <line>in the wood-path at Blithedale; and lastly, in Zenobia's drawing-room.</line>
        <line>It was Westervelt. A quick association of ideas made me shudder from</line>
        <line>head to foot; and again, like an evil spirit, bringing up reminiscences</line>
        <line>of a man's sins, I whispered a question in Hollingsworth's ear,--"What</line>
        <line>have you done with Priscilla?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>He gave a convulsive start, as if I had thrust a knife into him,</line>
        <line>writhed himself round on his seat, glared fiercely into my eyes, but</line>
        <line>answered not a word.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The Professor began his discourse, explanatory of the psychological</line>
        <line>phenomena, as he termed them, which it was his purpose to exhibit to</line>
        <line>the spectators. There remains no very distinct impression of it on my</line>
        <line>memory. It was eloquent, ingenious, plausible, with a delusive show of</line>
        <line>spirituality, yet really imbued throughout with a cold and dead</line>
        <line>materialism. I shivered, as at a current of chill air issuing out of a</line>
        <line>sepulchral vault, and bringing the smell of corruption along with it.</line>
        <line>He spoke of a new era that was dawning upon the world; an era that</line>
        <line>would link soul to soul, and the present life to what we call futurity,</line>
        <line>with a closeness that should finally convert both worlds into one</line>
        <line>great, mutually conscious brotherhood. He described (in a strange,</line>
        <line>philosophical guise, with terms of art, as if it were a matter of</line>
        <line>chemical discovery) the agency by which this mighty result was to be</line>
        <line>effected; nor would it have surprised me, had he pretended to hold up a</line>
        <line>portion of his universally pervasive fluid, as he affirmed it to be, in</line>
        <line>a glass phial.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>At the close of his exordium, the Professor beckoned with his</line>
        <line>hand,--once, twice, thrice,--and a figure came gliding upon the</line>
        <line>platform, enveloped in a long veil of silvery whiteness. It fell about</line>
        <line>her like the texture of a summer cloud, with a kind of vagueness, so</line>
        <line>that the outline of the form beneath it could not be accurately</line>
        <line>discerned. But the movement of the Veiled Lady was graceful, free, and</line>
        <line>unembarrassed, like that of a person accustomed to be the spectacle of</line>
        <line>thousands; or, possibly, a blindfold prisoner within the sphere with</line>
        <line>which this dark earthly magician had surrounded her, she was wholly</line>
        <line>unconscious of being the central object to all those straining eyes.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Pliant to his gesture (which had even an obsequious courtesy, but at</line>
        <line>the same time a remarkable decisiveness), the figure placed itself in</line>
        <line>the great chair. Sitting there, in such visible obscurity, it was,</line>
        <line>perhaps, as much like the actual presence of a disembodied spirit as</line>
        <line>anything that stage trickery could devise. The hushed breathing of the</line>
        <line>spectators proved how high-wrought were their anticipations of the</line>
        <line>wonders to be performed through the medium of this incomprehensible</line>
        <line>creature. I, too, was in breathless suspense, but with a far different</line>
        <line>presentiment of some strange event at hand.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You see before you the Veiled Lady," said the bearded Professor,</line>
        <line>advancing to the verge of the platform. "By the agency of which I have</line>
        <line>just spoken, she is at this moment in communion with the spiritual</line>
        <line>world. That silvery veil is, in one sense, an enchantment, having been</line>
        <line>dipped, as it were, and essentially imbued, through the potency of my</line>
        <line>art, with the fluid medium of spirits. Slight and ethereal as it</line>
        <line>seems, the limitations of time and space have no existence within its</line>
        <line>folds. This hall--these hundreds of faces, encompassing her within so</line>
        <line>narrow an amphitheatre--are of thinner substance, in her view, than the</line>
        <line>airiest vapor that the clouds are made of. She beholds the Absolute!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As preliminary to other and far more wonderful psychological</line>
        <line>experiments, the exhibitor suggested that some of his auditors should</line>
        <line>endeavor to make the Veiled Lady sensible of their presence by such</line>
        <line>methods--provided only no touch were laid upon her person--as they</line>
        <line>might deem best adapted to that end. Accordingly, several deep-lunged</line>
        <line>country fellows, who looked as if they might have blown the apparition</line>
        <line>away with a breath, ascended the platform. Mutually encouraging one</line>
        <line>another, they shouted so close to her ear that the veil stirred like a</line>
        <line>wreath of vanishing mist; they smote upon the floor with bludgeons;</line>
        <line>they perpetrated so hideous a clamor, that methought it might have</line>
        <line>reached, at least, a little way into the eternal sphere. Finally, with</line>
        <line>the assent of the Professor, they laid hold of the great chair, and</line>
        <line>were startled, apparently, to find it soar upward, as if lighter than</line>
        <line>the air through which it rose. But the Veiled Lady remained seated and</line>
        <line>motionless, with a composure that was hardly less than awful, because</line>
        <line>implying so immeasurable a distance betwixt her and these rude</line>
        <line>persecutors.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"These efforts are wholly without avail," observed the Professor, who</line>
        <line>had been looking on with an aspect of serene indifference. "The roar</line>
        <line>of a battery of cannon would be inaudible to the Veiled Lady. And yet,</line>
        <line>were I to will it, sitting in this very hall, she could hear the desert</line>
        <line>wind sweeping over the sands as far off as Arabia; the icebergs</line>
        <line>grinding one against the other in the polar seas; the rustle of a leaf</line>
        <line>in an East Indian forest; the lowest whispered breath of the</line>
        <line>bashfullest maiden in the world, uttering the first confession of her</line>
        <line>love. Nor does there exist the moral inducement, apart from my own</line>
        <line>behest, that could persuade her to lift the silvery veil, or arise out</line>
        <line>of that chair."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Greatly to the Professor's discomposure, however, just as he spoke</line>
        <line>these words, the Veiled Lady arose. There was a mysterious tremor that</line>
        <line>shook the magic veil. The spectators, it may be, imagined that she was</line>
        <line>about to take flight into that invisible sphere, and to the society of</line>
        <line>those purely spiritual beings with whom they reckoned her so near akin.</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, a moment ago, had mounted the platform, and now stood</line>
        <line>gazing at the figure, with a sad intentness that brought the whole</line>
        <line>power of his great, stern, yet tender soul into his glance.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Come," said he, waving his hand towards her. "You are safe!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She threw off the veil, and stood before that multitude of people pale,</line>
        <line>tremulous, shrinking, as if only then had she discovered that a</line>
        <line>thousand eyes were gazing at her. Poor maiden! How strangely had she</line>
        <line>been betrayed! Blazoned abroad as a wonder of the world, and</line>
        <line>performing what were adjudged as miracles,--in the faith of many, a</line>
        <line>seeress and a prophetess; in the harsher judgment of others, a</line>
        <line>mountebank,--she had kept, as I religiously believe, her virgin reserve</line>
        <line>and sanctity of soul throughout it all. Within that encircling veil,</line>
        <line>though an evil hand had flung it over her, there was as deep a</line>
        <line>seclusion as if this forsaken girl had, all the while, been sitting</line>
        <line>under the shadow of Eliot's pulpit, in the Blithedale woods, at the</line>
        <line>feet of him who now summoned her to the shelter of his arms. And the</line>
        <line>true heart-throb of a woman's affection was too powerful for the</line>
        <line>jugglery that had hitherto environed her. She uttered a shriek, and</line>
        <line>fled to Hollingsworth, like one escaping from her deadliest enemy, and</line>
        <line>was safe forever.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>THE MASQUERADERS</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Two nights had passed since the foregoing occurrences, when, in a</line>
        <line>breezy September forenoon, I set forth from town, on foot, towards</line>
        <line>Blithedale. It was the most delightful of all days for a walk, with a</line>
        <line>dash of invigorating ice-temper in the air, but a coolness that soon</line>
        <line>gave place to the brisk glow of exercise, while the vigor remained as</line>
        <line>elastic as before. The atmosphere had a spirit and sparkle in it.</line>
        <line>Each breath was like a sip of ethereal wine, tempered, as I said, with</line>
        <line>a crystal lump of ice. I had started on this expedition in an</line>
        <line>exceedingly sombre mood, as well befitted one who found himself tending</line>
        <line>towards home, but was conscious that nobody would be quite overjoyed to</line>
        <line>greet him there. My feet were hardly off the pavement, however, when</line>
        <line>this morbid sensation began to yield to the lively influences of air</line>
        <line>and motion. Nor had I gone far, with fields yet green on either side,</line>
        <line>before my step became as swift and light as if Hollingsworth were</line>
        <line>waiting to exchange a friendly hand-grip, and Zenobia's and Priscilla's</line>
        <line>open arms would welcome the wanderer's reappearance. It has happened</line>
        <line>to me on other occasions, as well as this, to prove how a state of</line>
        <line>physical well-being can create a kind of joy, in spite of the</line>
        <line>profoundest anxiety of mind.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The pathway of that walk still runs along, with sunny freshness,</line>
        <line>through my memory. I know not why it should be so. But my mental eye</line>
        <line>can even now discern the September grass, bordering the pleasant</line>
        <line>roadside with a brighter verdure than while the summer heats were</line>
        <line>scorching it; the trees, too, mostly green, although here and there a</line>
        <line>branch or shrub has donned its vesture of crimson and gold a week or</line>
        <line>two before its fellows. I see the tufted barberry-bushes, with their</line>
        <line>small clusters of scarlet fruit; the toadstools, likewise,--some</line>
        <line>spotlessly white, others yellow or red,--mysterious growths, springing</line>
        <line>suddenly from no root or seed, and growing nobody can tell how or</line>
        <line>wherefore. In this respect they resembled many of the emotions in my</line>
        <line>breast. And I still see the little rivulets, chill, clear, and bright,</line>
        <line>that murmured beneath the road, through subterranean rocks, and</line>
        <line>deepened into mossy pools, where tiny fish were darting to and fro, and</line>
        <line>within which lurked the hermit frog. But no,--I never can account for</line>
        <line>it, that, with a yearning interest to learn the upshot of all my story,</line>
        <line>and returning to Blithedale for that sole purpose, I should examine</line>
        <line>these things so like a peaceful-bosomed naturalist. Nor why, amid all</line>
        <line>my sympathies and fears, there shot, at times, a wild exhilaration</line>
        <line>through my frame.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Thus I pursued my way along the line of the ancient stone wall that</line>
        <line>Paul Dudley built, and through white villages, and past orchards of</line>
        <line>ruddy apples, and fields of ripening maize, and patches of woodland,</line>
        <line>and all such sweet rural scenery as looks the fairest, a little beyond</line>
        <line>the suburbs of a town. Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla! They glided</line>
        <line>mistily before me, as I walked. Sometimes, in my solitude, I laughed</line>
        <line>with the bitterness of self-scorn, remembering how unreservedly I had</line>
        <line>given up my heart and soul to interests that were not mine. What had I</line>
        <line>ever had to do with them? And why, being now free, should I take this</line>
        <line>thraldom on me once again? It was both sad and dangerous, I whispered</line>
        <line>to myself, to be in too close affinity with the passions, the errors,</line>
        <line>and the misfortunes of individuals who stood within a circle of their</line>
        <line>own, into which, if I stept at all, it must be as an intruder, and at a</line>
        <line>peril that I could not estimate.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Drawing nearer to Blithedale, a sickness of the spirits kept</line>
        <line>alternating with my flights of causeless buoyancy. I indulged in a</line>
        <line>hundred odd and extravagant conjectures. Either there was no such</line>
        <line>place as Blithedale, nor ever had been, nor any brotherhood of</line>
        <line>thoughtful laborers, like what I seemed to recollect there, or else it</line>
        <line>was all changed during my absence. It had been nothing but dream work</line>
        <line>and enchantment. I should seek in vain for the old farmhouse, and for</line>
        <line>the greensward, the potato-fields, the root-crops, and acres of Indian</line>
        <line>corn, and for all that configuration of the land which I had imagined.</line>
        <line>It would be another spot, and an utter strangeness.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>These vagaries were of the spectral throng so apt to steal out of an</line>
        <line>unquiet heart. They partly ceased to haunt me, on my arriving at a</line>
        <line>point whence, through the trees, I began to catch glimpses of the</line>
        <line>Blithedale farm. That surely was something real. There was hardly a</line>
        <line>square foot of all those acres on which I had not trodden heavily, in</line>
        <line>one or another kind of toil. The curse of Adam's posterity--and, curse</line>
        <line>or blessing be it, it gives substance to the life around us--had first</line>
        <line>come upon me there. In the sweat of my brow I had there earned bread</line>
        <line>and eaten it, and so established my claim to be on earth, and my</line>
        <line>fellowship with all the sons of labor. I could have knelt down, and</line>
        <line>have laid my breast against that soil. The red clay of which my frame</line>
        <line>was moulded seemed nearer akin to those crumbling furrows than to any</line>
        <line>other portion of the world's dust. There was my home, and there might</line>
        <line>be my grave.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I felt an invincible reluctance, nevertheless, at the idea of</line>
        <line>presenting myself before my old associates, without first ascertaining</line>
        <line>the state in which they were. A nameless foreboding weighed upon me.</line>
        <line>Perhaps, should I know all the circumstances that had occurred, I might</line>
        <line>find it my wisest course to turn back, unrecognized, unseen, and never</line>
        <line>look at Blithedale more. Had it been evening, I would have stolen</line>
        <line>softly to some lighted window of the old farmhouse, and peeped darkling</line>
        <line>in, to see all their well-known faces round the supper-board. Then,</line>
        <line>were there a vacant seat, I might noiselessly unclose the door, glide</line>
        <line>in, and take my place among them, without a word. My entrance might be</line>
        <line>so quiet, my aspect so familiar, that they would forget how long I had</line>
        <line>been away, and suffer me to melt into the scene, as a wreath of vapor</line>
        <line>melts into a larger cloud. I dreaded a boisterous greeting. Beholding</line>
        <line>me at table, Zenobia, as a matter of course, would send me a cup of</line>
        <line>tea, and Hollingsworth fill my plate from the great dish of pandowdy,</line>
        <line>and Priscilla, in her quiet way, would hand the cream, and others help</line>
        <line>me to the bread and butter. Being one of them again, the knowledge of</line>
        <line>what had happened would come to me without a shock. For still, at</line>
        <line>every turn of my shifting fantasies, the thought stared me in the face</line>
        <line>that some evil thing had befallen us, or was ready to befall.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Yielding to this ominous impression, I now turned aside into the woods,</line>
        <line>resolving to spy out the posture of the Community as craftily as the</line>
        <line>wild Indian before he makes his onset. I would go wandering about the</line>
        <line>outskirts of the farm, and, perhaps, catching sight of a solitary</line>
        <line>acquaintance, would approach him amid the brown shadows of the trees (a</line>
        <line>kind of medium fit for spirits departed and revisitant, like myself),</line>
        <line>and entreat him to tell me how all things were.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The first living creature that I met was a partridge, which sprung up</line>
        <line>beneath my feet, and whirred away; the next was a squirrel, who</line>
        <line>chattered angrily at me from an overhanging bough. I trod along by the</line>
        <line>dark, sluggish river, and remember pausing on the bank, above one of</line>
        <line>its blackest and most placid pools (the very spot, with the barkless</line>
        <line>stump of a tree aslantwise over the water, is depicting itself to my</line>
        <line>fancy at this instant), and wondering how deep it was, and if any</line>
        <line>overladen soul had ever flung its weight of mortality in thither, and</line>
        <line>if it thus escaped the burden, or only made it heavier. And perhaps the</line>
        <line>skeleton of the drowned wretch still lay beneath the inscrutable depth,</line>
        <line>clinging to some sunken log at the bottom with the gripe of its old</line>
        <line>despair. So slight, however, was the track of these gloomy ideas, that</line>
        <line>I soon forgot them in the contemplation of a brood of wild ducks, which</line>
        <line>were floating on the river, and anon took flight, leaving each a bright</line>
        <line>streak over the black surface. By and by, I came to my hermitage, in</line>
        <line>the heart of the white-pine tree, and clambering up into it, sat down</line>
        <line>to rest. The grapes, which I had watched throughout the summer, now</line>
        <line>dangled around me in abundant clusters of the deepest purple,</line>
        <line>deliciously sweet to the taste, and, though wild, yet free from that</line>
        <line>ungentle flavor which distinguishes nearly all our native and</line>
        <line>uncultivated grapes. Methought a wine might be pressed out of them</line>
        <line>possessing a passionate zest, and endowed with a new kind of</line>
        <line>intoxicating quality, attended with such bacchanalian ecstasies as the</line>
        <line>tamer grapes of Madeira, France, and the Rhine are inadequate to</line>
        <line>produce. And I longed to quaff a great goblet of it that moment!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>While devouring the grapes, I looked on all sides out of the peep-holes</line>
        <line>of my hermitage, and saw the farmhouse, the fields, and almost every</line>
        <line>part of our domain, but not a single human figure in the landscape.</line>
        <line>Some of the windows of the house were open, but with no more signs of</line>
        <line>life than in a dead man's unshut eyes. The barn-door was ajar, and</line>
        <line>swinging in the breeze. The big old dog,--he was a relic of the former</line>
        <line>dynasty of the farm,--that hardly ever stirred out of the yard, was</line>
        <line>nowhere to be seen. What, then, had become of all the fraternity and</line>
        <line>sisterhood? Curious to ascertain this point, I let myself down out of</line>
        <line>the tree, and going to the edge of the wood, was glad to perceive our</line>
        <line>herd of cows chewing the cud or grazing not far off. I fancied, by</line>
        <line>their manner, that two or three of them recognized me (as, indeed, they</line>
        <line>ought, for I had milked them and been their chamberlain times without</line>
        <line>number); but, after staring me in the face a little while, they</line>
        <line>phlegmatically began grazing and chewing their cuds again. Then I grew</line>
        <line>foolishly angry at so cold a reception, and flung some rotten fragments</line>
        <line>of an old stump at these unsentimental cows.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Skirting farther round the pasture, I heard voices and much laughter</line>
        <line>proceeding from the interior of the wood. Voices, male and feminine;</line>
        <line>laughter, not only of fresh young throats, but the bass of grown</line>
        <line>people, as if solemn organ-pipes should pour out airs of merriment. Not</line>
        <line>a voice spoke, but I knew it better than my own; not a laugh, but its</line>
        <line>cadences were familiar. The wood, in this portion of it, seemed as</line>
        <line>full of jollity as if Comus and his crew were holding their revels in</line>
        <line>one of its usually lonesome glades. Stealing onward as far as I durst,</line>
        <line>without hazard of discovery, I saw a concourse of strange figures</line>
        <line>beneath the overshadowing branches. They appeared, and vanished, and</line>
        <line>came again, confusedly with the streaks of sunlight glimmering down</line>
        <line>upon them.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Among them was an Indian chief, with blanket, feathers, and war-paint,</line>
        <line>and uplifted tomahawk; and near him, looking fit to be his woodland</line>
        <line>bride, the goddess Diana, with the crescent on her head, and attended</line>
        <line>by our big lazy dog, in lack of any fleeter hound. Drawing an arrow</line>
        <line>from her quiver, she let it fly at a venture, and hit the very tree</line>
        <line>behind which I happened to be lurking. Another group consisted of a</line>
        <line>Bavarian broom-girl, a negro of the Jim Crow order, one or two</line>
        <line>foresters of the Middle Ages, a Kentucky woodsman in his trimmed</line>
        <line>hunting-shirt and deerskin leggings, and a Shaker elder, quaint,</line>
        <line>demure, broad-brimmed, and square-skirted. Shepherds of Arcadia, and</line>
        <line>allegoric figures from the "Faerie Queen," were oddly mixed up with</line>
        <line>these. Arm in arm, or otherwise huddled together in strange</line>
        <line>discrepancy, stood grim Puritans, gay Cavaliers, and Revolutionary</line>
        <line>officers with three-cornered cocked hats, and queues longer than their</line>
        <line>swords. A bright-complexioned, dark-haired, vivacious little gypsy,</line>
        <line>with a red shawl over her head, went from one group to another, telling</line>
        <line>fortunes by palmistry; and Moll Pitcher, the renowned old witch of</line>
        <line>Lynn, broomstick in hand, showed herself prominently in the midst, as</line>
        <line>if announcing all these apparitions to be the offspring of her</line>
        <line>necromantic art. But Silas Foster, who leaned against a tree near by,</line>
        <line>in his customary blue frock and smoking a short pipe, did more to</line>
        <line>disenchant the scene, with his look of shrewd, acrid, Yankee</line>
        <line>observation, than twenty witches and necromancers could have done in</line>
        <line>the way of rendering it weird and fantastic.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>A little farther off, some old-fashioned skinkers and drawers, all with</line>
        <line>portentously red noses, were spreading a banquet on the leaf-strewn</line>
        <line>earth; while a horned and long-tailed gentleman (in whom I recognized</line>
        <line>the fiendish musician erst seen by Tam O'Shanter) tuned his fiddle, and</line>
        <line>summoned the whole motley rout to a dance, before partaking of the</line>
        <line>festal cheer. So they joined hands in a circle, whirling round so</line>
        <line>swiftly, so madly, and so merrily, in time and tune with the Satanic</line>
        <line>music, that their separate incongruities were blended all together, and</line>
        <line>they became a kind of entanglement that went nigh to turn one's brain</line>
        <line>with merely looking at it. Anon they stopt all of a sudden, and</line>
        <line>staring at one another's figures, set up a roar of laughter; whereat a</line>
        <line>shower of the September leaves (which, all day long, had been</line>
        <line>hesitating whether to fall or no) were shaken off by the movement of</line>
        <line>the air, and came eddying down upon the revellers.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Then, for lack of breath, ensued a silence, at the deepest point of</line>
        <line>which, tickled by the oddity of surprising my grave associates in this</line>
        <line>masquerading trim, I could not possibly refrain from a burst of</line>
        <line>laughter on my own separate account.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Hush!" I heard the pretty gypsy fortuneteller say. "Who is that</line>
        <line>laughing?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Some profane intruder!" said the goddess Diana. "I shall send an</line>
        <line>arrow through his heart, or change him into a stag, as I did Actaeon,</line>
        <line>if he peeps from behind the trees!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Me take his scalp!" cried the Indian chief, brandishing his tomahawk,</line>
        <line>and cutting a great caper in the air.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I'll root him in the earth with a spell that I have at my tongue's</line>
        <line>end!" squeaked Moll Pitcher. "And the green moss shall grow all over</line>
        <line>him, before he gets free again!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"The voice was Miles Coverdale's," said the fiendish fiddler, with a</line>
        <line>whisk of his tail and a toss of his horns. "My music has brought him</line>
        <line>hither. He is always ready to dance to the Devil's tune!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Thus put on the right track, they all recognized the voice at once, and</line>
        <line>set up a simultaneous shout.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Miles! Miles! Miles Coverdale, where are you?" they cried. "Zenobia!</line>
        <line>Queen Zenobia! here is one of your vassals lurking in the wood.</line>
        <line>Command him to approach and pay his duty!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The whole fantastic rabble forthwith streamed off in pursuit of me, so</line>
        <line>that I was like a mad poet hunted by chimeras. Having fairly the start</line>
        <line>of them, however, I succeeded in making my escape, and soon left their</line>
        <line>merriment and riot at a good distance in the rear. Its fainter tones</line>
        <line>assumed a kind of mournfulness, and were finally lost in the hush and</line>
        <line>solemnity of the wood. In my haste, I stumbled over a heap of logs and</line>
        <line>sticks that had been cut for firewood, a great while ago, by some</line>
        <line>former possessor of the soil, and piled up square, in order to be</line>
        <line>carted or sledded away to the farmhouse. But, being forgotten, they</line>
        <line>had lain there perhaps fifty years, and possibly much longer; until, by</line>
        <line>the accumulation of moss, and the leaves falling over them, and</line>
        <line>decaying there, from autumn to autumn, a green mound was formed, in</line>
        <line>which the softened outline of the woodpile was still perceptible. In</line>
        <line>the fitful mood that then swayed my mind, I found something strangely</line>
        <line>affecting in this simple circumstance. I imagined the long-dead</line>
        <line>woodman, and his long-dead wife and children, coming out of their chill</line>
        <line>graves, and essaying to make a fire with this heap of mossy fuel!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>From this spot I strayed onward, quite lost in reverie, and neither</line>
        <line>knew nor cared whither I was going, until a low, soft, well-remembered</line>
        <line>voice spoke, at a little distance.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"There is Mr. Coverdale!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Miles Coverdale!" said another voice,--and its tones were very stern.</line>
        <line>"Let him come forward, then!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Yes, Mr. Coverdale," cried a woman's voice,--clear and melodious, but,</line>
        <line>just then, with something unnatural in its chord,--"you are welcome!</line>
        <line>But you come half an hour too late, and have missed a scene which you</line>
        <line>would have enjoyed!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I looked up and found myself nigh Eliot's pulpit, at the base of which</line>
        <line>sat Hollingsworth, with Priscilla at his feet and Zenobia standing</line>
        <line>before them.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>THE THREE TOGETHER</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hollingsworth was in his ordinary working-dress. Priscilla wore a</line>
        <line>pretty and simple gown, with a kerchief about her neck, and a calash,</line>
        <line>which she had flung back from her head, leaving it suspended by the</line>
        <line>strings. But Zenobia (whose part among the maskers, as may be</line>
        <line>supposed, was no inferior one) appeared in a costume of fanciful</line>
        <line>magnificence, with her jewelled flower as the central ornament of what</line>
        <line>resembled a leafy crown, or coronet. She represented the Oriental</line>
        <line>princess by whose name we were accustomed to know her. Her attitude</line>
        <line>was free and noble; yet, if a queen's, it was not that of a queen</line>
        <line>triumphant, but dethroned, on trial for her life, or, perchance,</line>
        <line>condemned already. The spirit of the conflict seemed, nevertheless, to</line>
        <line>be alive in her. Her eyes were on fire; her cheeks had each a crimson</line>
        <line>spot, so exceedingly vivid, and marked with so definite an outline,</line>
        <line>that I at first doubted whether it were not artificial. In a very</line>
        <line>brief space, however, this idea was shamed by the paleness that ensued,</line>
        <line>as the blood sunk suddenly away. Zenobia now looked like marble.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>One always feels the fact, in an instant, when he has intruded on those</line>
        <line>who love, or those who hate, at some acme of their passion that puts</line>
        <line>them into a sphere of their own, where no other spirit can pretend to</line>
        <line>stand on equal ground with them. I was confused,--affected even with a</line>
        <line>species of terror,--and wished myself away. The intenseness of their</line>
        <line>feelings gave them the exclusive property of the soil and atmosphere,</line>
        <line>and left me no right to be or breathe there.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Hollingsworth,--Zenobia,--I have just returned to Blithedale," said I,</line>
        <line>"and had no thought of finding you here. We shall meet again at the</line>
        <line>house. I will retire."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"This place is free to you," answered Hollingsworth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"As free as to ourselves," added Zenobia. "This long while past, you</line>
        <line>have been following up your game, groping for human emotions in the</line>
        <line>dark corners of the heart. Had you been here a little sooner, you</line>
        <line>might have seen them dragged into the daylight. I could even wish to</line>
        <line>have my trial over again, with you standing by to see fair play! Do</line>
        <line>you know, Mr. Coverdale, I have been on trial for my life?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She laughed, while speaking thus. But, in truth, as my eyes wandered</line>
        <line>from one of the group to another, I saw in Hollingsworth all that an</line>
        <line>artist could desire for the grim portrait of a Puritan magistrate</line>
        <line>holding inquest of life and death in a case of witchcraft; in Zenobia,</line>
        <line>the sorceress herself, not aged, wrinkled, and decrepit, but fair</line>
        <line>enough to tempt Satan with a force reciprocal to his own; and, in</line>
        <line>Priscilla, the pale victim, whose soul and body had been wasted by her</line>
        <line>spells. Had a pile of fagots been heaped against the rock, this hint</line>
        <line>of impending doom would have completed the suggestive picture.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It was too hard upon me," continued Zenobia, addressing Hollingsworth,</line>
        <line>"that judge, jury, and accuser should all be comprehended in one man!</line>
        <line>I demur, as I think the lawyers say, to the jurisdiction. But let the</line>
        <line>learned Judge Coverdale seat himself on the top of the rock, and you</line>
        <line>and me stand at its base, side by side, pleading our cause before him!</line>
        <line>There might, at least, be two criminals instead of one."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You forced this on me," replied Hollingsworth, looking her sternly in</line>
        <line>the face. "Did I call you hither from among the masqueraders yonder?</line>
        <line>Do I assume to be your judge? No; except so far as I have an</line>
        <line>unquestionable right of judgment, in order to settle my own line of</line>
        <line>behavior towards those with whom the events of life bring me in</line>
        <line>contact. True, I have already judged you, but not on the world's</line>
        <line>part,--neither do I pretend to pass a sentence!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, this is very good!" cried Zenobia with a smile. "What strange</line>
        <line>beings you men are, Mr. Coverdale!--is it not so? It is the simplest</line>
        <line>thing in the world with you to bring a woman before your secret</line>
        <line>tribunals, and judge and condemn her unheard, and then tell her to go</line>
        <line>free without a sentence. The misfortune is, that this same secret</line>
        <line>tribunal chances to be the only judgment-seat that a true woman stands</line>
        <line>in awe of, and that any verdict short of acquittal is equivalent to a</line>
        <line>death sentence!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The more I looked at them, and the more I heard, the stronger grew my</line>
        <line>impression that a crisis had just come and gone. On Hollingsworth's</line>
        <line>brow it had left a stamp like that of irrevocable doom, of which his</line>
        <line>own will was the instrument. In Zenobia's whole person, beholding her</line>
        <line>more closely, I saw a riotous agitation; the almost delirious</line>
        <line>disquietude of a great struggle, at the close of which the vanquished</line>
        <line>one felt her strength and courage still mighty within her, and longed</line>
        <line>to renew the contest. My sensations were as if I had come upon a</line>
        <line>battlefield before the smoke was as yet cleared away.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And what subjects had been discussed here? All, no doubt, that for so</line>
        <line>many months past had kept my heart and my imagination idly feverish.</line>
        <line>Zenobia's whole character and history; the true nature of her</line>
        <line>mysterious connection with Westervelt; her later purposes towards</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, and, reciprocally, his in reference to her; and,</line>
        <line>finally, the degree in which Zenobia had been cognizant of the plot</line>
        <line>against Priscilla, and what, at last, had been the real object of that</line>
        <line>scheme. On these points, as before, I was left to my own conjectures.</line>
        <line>One thing, only, was certain. Zenobia and Hollingsworth were friends</line>
        <line>no longer. If their heartstrings were ever intertwined, the knot had</line>
        <line>been adjudged an entanglement, and was now violently broken.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But Zenobia seemed unable to rest content with the matter in the</line>
        <line>posture which it had assumed.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah! do we part so?" exclaimed she, seeing Hollingsworth about to</line>
        <line>retire.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And why not?" said he, with almost rude abruptness. "What is there</line>
        <line>further to be said between us?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, perhaps nothing," answered Zenobia, looking him in the face, and</line>
        <line>smiling. "But we have come many times before to this gray rock, and we</line>
        <line>have talked very softly among the whisperings of the birch-trees. They</line>
        <line>were pleasant hours! I love to make the latest of them, though not</line>
        <line>altogether so delightful, loiter away as slowly as may be. And,</line>
        <line>besides, you have put many queries to me at this, which you design to</line>
        <line>be our last interview; and being driven, as I must acknowledge, into a</line>
        <line>corner, I have responded with reasonable frankness. But now, with your</line>
        <line>free consent, I desire the privilege of asking a few questions, in my</line>
        <line>turn."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I have no concealments," said Hollingsworth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"We shall see," answered Zenobia. "I would first inquire whether you</line>
        <line>have supposed me to be wealthy?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"On that point," observed Hollingsworth, "I have had the opinion which</line>
        <line>the world holds."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And I held it likewise," said Zenobia. "Had I not, Heaven is my</line>
        <line>witness the knowledge should have been as free to you as me. It is</line>
        <line>only three days since I knew the strange fact that threatens to make me</line>
        <line>poor; and your own acquaintance with it, I suspect, is of at least as</line>
        <line>old a date. I fancied myself affluent. You are aware, too, of the</line>
        <line>disposition which I purposed making of the larger portion of my</line>
        <line>imaginary opulence,--nay, were it all, I had not hesitated. Let me ask</line>
        <line>you, further, did I ever propose or intimate any terms of compact, on</line>
        <line>which depended this--as the world would consider it--so important</line>
        <line>sacrifice?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You certainly spoke of none," said Hollingsworth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Nor meant any," she responded. "I was willing to realize your dream</line>
        <line>freely,--generously, as some might think,--but, at all events, fully,</line>
        <line>and heedless though it should prove the ruin of my fortune. If, in your</line>
        <line>own thoughts, you have imposed any conditions of this expenditure, it</line>
        <line>is you that must be held responsible for whatever is sordid and</line>
        <line>unworthy in them. And now one other question. Do you love this girl?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"O Zenobia!" exclaimed Priscilla, shrinking back, as if longing for the</line>
        <line>rock to topple over and hide her.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Do you love her?" repeated Zenobia.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Had you asked me that question a short time since," replied</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, after a pause, during which, it seemed to me, even the</line>
        <line>birch-trees held their whispering breath, "I should have told</line>
        <line>you--'No!' My feelings for Priscilla differed little from those of an</line>
        <line>elder brother, watching tenderly over the gentle sister whom God has</line>
        <line>given him to protect."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And what is your answer now?" persisted Zenobia.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I do love her!" said Hollingsworth, uttering the words with a deep</line>
        <line>inward breath, instead of speaking them outright. "As well declare it</line>
        <line>thus as in any other way. I do love her!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Now, God be judge between us," cried Zenobia, breaking into sudden</line>
        <line>passion, "which of us two has most mortally offended Him! At least, I</line>
        <line>am a woman, with every fault, it may be, that a woman ever had,--weak,</line>
        <line>vain, unprincipled (like most of my sex; for our virtues, when we have</line>
        <line>any, are merely impulsive and intuitive), passionate, too, and pursuing</line>
        <line>my foolish and unattainable ends by indirect and cunning, though</line>
        <line>absurdly chosen means, as an hereditary bond-slave must; false,</line>
        <line>moreover, to the whole circle of good, in my reckless truth to the</line>
        <line>little good I saw before me,--but still a woman! A creature whom only</line>
        <line>a little change of earthly fortune, a little kinder smile of Him who</line>
        <line>sent me hither, and one true heart to encourage and direct me, might</line>
        <line>have made all that a woman can be! But how is it with you? Are you a</line>
        <line>man? No; but a monster! A cold, heartless, self-beginning and</line>
        <line>self-ending piece of mechanism!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"With what, then, do you charge me!" asked Hollingsworth, aghast, and</line>
        <line>greatly disturbed by this attack. "Show me one selfish end, in all I</line>
        <line>ever aimed at, and you may cut it out of my bosom with a knife!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It is all self!" answered Zenobia with still intenser bitterness.</line>
        <line>"Nothing else; nothing but self, self, self! The fiend, I doubt not,</line>
        <line>has made his choicest mirth of you these seven years past, and</line>
        <line>especially in the mad summer which we have spent together. I see it</line>
        <line>now! I am awake, disenchanted, disinthralled! Self, self, self! You</line>
        <line>have embodied yourself in a project. You are a better masquerader than</line>
        <line>the witches and gypsies yonder; for your disguise is a self-deception.</line>
        <line>See whither it has brought you! First, you aimed a death-blow, and a</line>
        <line>treacherous one, at this scheme of a purer and higher life, which so</line>
        <line>many noble spirits had wrought out. Then, because Coverdale could not</line>
        <line>be quite your slave, you threw him ruthlessly away. And you took me,</line>
        <line>too, into your plan, as long as there was hope of my being available,</line>
        <line>and now fling me aside again, a broken tool! But, foremost and</line>
        <line>blackest of your sins, you stifled down your inmost consciousness!--you</line>
        <line>did a deadly wrong to your own heart!--you were ready to sacrifice this</line>
        <line>girl, whom, if God ever visibly showed a purpose, He put into your</line>
        <line>charge, and through whom He was striving to redeem you!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"This is a woman's view," said Hollingsworth, growing deadly pale,--"a</line>
        <line>woman's, whose whole sphere of action is in the heart, and who can</line>
        <line>conceive of no higher nor wider one!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Be silent!" cried Zenobia imperiously. "You know neither man nor</line>
        <line>woman! The utmost that can be said in your behalf--and because I would</line>
        <line>not be wholly despicable in my own eyes, but would fain excuse my</line>
        <line>wasted feelings, nor own it wholly a delusion, therefore I say it--is,</line>
        <line>that a great and rich heart has been ruined in your breast. Leave me,</line>
        <line>now. You have done with me, and I with you. Farewell!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Priscilla," said Hollingsworth, "come." Zenobia smiled; possibly I</line>
        <line>did so too. Not often, in human life, has a gnawing sense of injury</line>
        <line>found a sweeter morsel of revenge than was conveyed in the tone with</line>
        <line>which Hollingsworth spoke those two words. It was the abased and</line>
        <line>tremulous tone of a man whose faith in himself was shaken, and who</line>
        <line>sought, at last, to lean on an affection. Yes; the strong man bowed</line>
        <line>himself and rested on this poor Priscilla! Oh, could she have failed</line>
        <line>him, what a triumph for the lookers-on!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And, at first, I half imagined that she was about to fail him. She</line>
        <line>rose up, stood shivering like the birch leaves that trembled over her</line>
        <line>head, and then slowly tottered, rather than walked, towards Zenobia.</line>
        <line>Arriving at her feet, she sank down there, in the very same attitude</line>
        <line>which she had assumed on their first meeting, in the kitchen of the old</line>
        <line>farmhouse. Zenobia remembered it.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ah, Priscilla!" said she, shaking her head, "how much is changed since</line>
        <line>then! You kneel to a dethroned princess. You, the victorious one!</line>
        <line>But he is waiting for you. Say what you wish, and leave me."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"We are sisters!" gasped Priscilla.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I fancied that I understood the word and action. It meant the offering</line>
        <line>of herself, and all she had, to be at Zenobia's disposal. But the</line>
        <line>latter would not take it thus.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"True, we are sisters!" she replied; and, moved by the sweet word, she</line>
        <line>stooped down and kissed Priscilla; but not lovingly, for a sense of</line>
        <line>fatal harm received through her seemed to be lurking in Zenobia's</line>
        <line>heart. "We had one father! You knew it from the first; I, but a</line>
        <line>little while,--else some things that have chanced might have been</line>
        <line>spared you. But I never wished you harm. You stood between me and an</line>
        <line>end which I desired. I wanted a clear path. No matter what I meant.</line>
        <line>It is over now. Do you forgive me?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"O Zenobia," sobbed Priscilla, "it is I that feel like the guilty one!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No, no, poor little thing!" said Zenobia, with a sort of contempt.</line>
        <line>"You have been my evil fate, but there never was a babe with less</line>
        <line>strength or will to do an injury. Poor child! Methinks you have but a</line>
        <line>melancholy lot before you, sitting all alone in that wide, cheerless</line>
        <line>heart, where, for aught you know,--and as I, alas! believe,--the fire</line>
        <line>which you have kindled may soon go out. Ah, the thought makes me</line>
        <line>shiver for you! What will you do, Priscilla, when you find no spark</line>
        <line>among the ashes?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Die!" she answered.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"That was well said!" responded Zenobia, with an approving smile.</line>
        <line>"There is all a woman in your little compass, my poor sister.</line>
        <line>Meanwhile, go with him, and live!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She waved her away with a queenly gesture, and turned her own face to</line>
        <line>the rock. I watched Priscilla, wondering what judgment she would pass</line>
        <line>between Zenobia and Hollingsworth; how interpret his behavior, so as to</line>
        <line>reconcile it with true faith both towards her sister and herself; how</line>
        <line>compel her love for him to keep any terms whatever with her sisterly</line>
        <line>affection! But, in truth, there was no such difficulty as I imagined.</line>
        <line>Her engrossing love made it all clear. Hollingsworth could have no</line>
        <line>fault. That was the one principle at the centre of the universe. And</line>
        <line>the doubtful guilt or possible integrity of other people, appearances,</line>
        <line>self-evident facts, the testimony of her own senses,--even</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's self-accusation, had he volunteered it,--would have</line>
        <line>weighed not the value of a mote of thistledown on the other side. So</line>
        <line>secure was she of his right, that she never thought of comparing it</line>
        <line>with another's wrong, but left the latter to itself.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hollingsworth drew her arm within his, and soon disappeared with her</line>
        <line>among the trees. I cannot imagine how Zenobia knew when they were out</line>
        <line>of sight; she never glanced again towards them. But, retaining a proud</line>
        <line>attitude so long as they might have thrown back a retiring look, they</line>
        <line>were no sooner departed,--utterly departed,--than she began slowly to</line>
        <line>sink down. It was as if a great, invisible, irresistible weight were</line>
        <line>pressing her to the earth. Settling upon her knees, she leaned her</line>
        <line>forehead against the rock, and sobbed convulsively; dry sobs they</line>
        <line>seemed to be, such as have nothing to do with tears.</line>
    </p>

    <p>
        <title>ZENOBIA AND COVERDALE</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Zenobia had entirely forgotten me. She fancied herself alone with her</line>
        <line>great grief. And had it been only a common pity that I felt for</line>
        <line>her,--the pity that her proud nature would have repelled, as the one</line>
        <line>worst wrong which the world yet held in reserve,--the sacredness and</line>
        <line>awfulness of the crisis might have impelled me to steal away silently,</line>
        <line>so that not a dry leaf should rustle under my feet. I would have left</line>
        <line>her to struggle, in that solitude, with only the eye of God upon her.</line>
        <line>But, so it happened, I never once dreamed of questioning my right to be</line>
        <line>there now, as I had questioned it just before, when I came so suddenly</line>
        <line>upon Hollingsworth and herself, in the passion of their recent debate.</line>
        <line>It suits me not to explain what was the analogy that I saw or imagined</line>
        <line>between Zenobia's situation and mine; nor, I believe, will the reader</line>
        <line>detect this one secret, hidden beneath many a revelation which perhaps</line>
        <line>concerned me less. In simple truth, however, as Zenobia leaned her</line>
        <line>forehead against the rock, shaken with that tearless agony, it seemed</line>
        <line>to me that the self-same pang, with hardly mitigated torment, leaped</line>
        <line>thrilling from her heartstrings to my own. Was it wrong, therefore, if</line>
        <line>I felt myself consecrated to the priesthood by sympathy like this, and</line>
        <line>called upon to minister to this woman's affliction, so far as mortal</line>
        <line>could?</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But, indeed, what could mortal do for her? Nothing! The attempt would</line>
        <line>be a mockery and an anguish. Time, it is true, would steal away her</line>
        <line>grief, and bury it and the best of her heart in the same grave. But</line>
        <line>Destiny itself, methought, in its kindliest mood, could do no better</line>
        <line>for Zenobia, in the way of quick relief; than to cause the impending</line>
        <line>rock to impend a little farther, and fall upon her head. So I leaned</line>
        <line>against a tree, and listened to her sobs, in unbroken silence. She was</line>
        <line>half prostrate, half kneeling, with her forehead still pressed against</line>
        <line>the rock. Her sobs were the only sound; she did not groan, nor give</line>
        <line>any other utterance to her distress. It was all involuntary.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>At length she sat up, put back her hair, and stared about her with a</line>
        <line>bewildered aspect, as if not distinctly recollecting the scene through</line>
        <line>which she had passed, nor cognizant of the situation in which it left</line>
        <line>her. Her face and brow were almost purple with the rush of blood.</line>
        <line>They whitened, however, by and by, and for some time retained this</line>
        <line>deathlike hue. She put her hand to her forehead, with a gesture that</line>
        <line>made me forcibly conscious of an intense and living pain there.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Her glance, wandering wildly to and fro, passed over me several times,</line>
        <line>without appearing to inform her of my presence. But, finally, a look</line>
        <line>of recognition gleamed from her eyes into mine.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Is it you, Miles Coverdale?" said she, smiling. "Ah, I perceive what</line>
        <line>you are about! You are turning this whole affair into a ballad. Pray</line>
        <line>let me hear as many stanzas as you happen to have ready."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Oh, hush, Zenobia!" I answered. "Heaven knows what an ache is in my</line>
        <line>soul!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It is genuine tragedy, is it not?" rejoined Zenobia, with a sharp,</line>
        <line>light laugh. "And you are willing to allow, perhaps, that I have had</line>
        <line>hard measure. But it is a woman's doom, and I have deserved it like a</line>
        <line>woman; so let there be no pity, as, on my part, there shall be no</line>
        <line>complaint. It is all right, now, or will shortly be so. But, Mr.</line>
        <line>Coverdale, by all means write this ballad, and put your soul's ache</line>
        <line>into it, and turn your sympathy to good account, as other poets do, and</line>
        <line>as poets must, unless they choose to give us glittering icicles instead</line>
        <line>of lines of fire. As for the moral, it shall be distilled into the</line>
        <line>final stanza, in a drop of bitter honey."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What shall it be, Zenobia?" I inquired, endeavoring to fall in with</line>
        <line>her mood.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Oh, a very old one will serve the purpose," she replied. "There are</line>
        <line>no new truths, much as we have prided ourselves on finding some. A</line>
        <line>moral? Why, this: That, in the battlefield of life, the downright</line>
        <line>stroke, that would fall only on a man's steel headpiece, is sure to</line>
        <line>light on a woman's heart, over which she wears no breastplate, and</line>
        <line>whose wisdom it is, therefore, to keep out of the conflict. Or, this:</line>
        <line>That the whole universe, her own sex and yours, and Providence, or</line>
        <line>Destiny, to boot, make common cause against the woman who swerves one</line>
        <line>hair's-breadth out of the beaten track. Yes; and add (for I may as</line>
        <line>well own it, now) that, with that one hair's-breadth, she goes all</line>
        <line>astray, and never sees the world in its true aspect afterwards."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"This last is too stern a moral," I observed. "Cannot we soften it a</line>
        <line>little?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Do it if you like, at your own peril, not on my responsibility," she</line>
        <line>answered. Then, with a sudden change of subject, she went on: "After</line>
        <line>all, he has flung away what would have served him better than the poor,</line>
        <line>pale flower he kept. What can Priscilla do for him? Put passionate</line>
        <line>warmth into his heart, when it shall be chilled with frozen hopes?</line>
        <line>Strengthen his hands, when they are weary with much doing and no</line>
        <line>performance? No! but only tend towards him with a blind, instinctive</line>
        <line>love, and hang her little, puny weakness for a clog upon his arm! She</line>
        <line>cannot even give him such sympathy as is worth the name. For will he</line>
        <line>never, in many an hour of darkness, need that proud intellectual</line>
        <line>sympathy which he might have had from me?--the sympathy that would</line>
        <line>flash light along his course, and guide, as well as cheer him? Poor</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth! Where will he find it now?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Hollingsworth has a heart of ice!" said I bitterly. "He is a wretch!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Do him no wrong," interrupted Zenobia, turning haughtily upon me.</line>
        <line>"Presume not to estimate a man like Hollingsworth. It was my fault,</line>
        <line>all along, and none of his. I see it now! He never sought me. Why</line>
        <line>should he seek me? What had I to offer him? A miserable, bruised, and</line>
        <line>battered heart, spoilt long before he met me. A life, too, hopelessly</line>
        <line>entangled with a villain's! He did well to cast me off. God be</line>
        <line>praised, he did it! And yet, had he trusted me, and borne with me a</line>
        <line>little longer, I would have saved him all this trouble."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She was silent for a time, and stood with her eyes fixed on the ground.</line>
        <line>Again raising them, her look was more mild and calm.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Miles Coverdale!" said she.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, Zenobia," I responded. "Can I do you any service?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Very little," she replied. "But it is my purpose, as you may well</line>
        <line>imagine, to remove from Blithedale; and, most likely, I may not see</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth again. A woman in my position, you understand, feels</line>
        <line>scarcely at her ease among former friends. New faces,--unaccustomed</line>
        <line>looks,--those only can she tolerate. She would pine among familiar</line>
        <line>scenes; she would be apt to blush, too, under the eyes that knew her</line>
        <line>secret; her heart might throb uncomfortably; she would mortify herself,</line>
        <line>I suppose, with foolish notions of having sacrificed the honor of her</line>
        <line>sex at the foot of proud, contumacious man. Poor womanhood, with its</line>
        <line>rights and wrongs! Here will be new matter for my course of lectures,</line>
        <line>at the idea of which you smiled, Mr. Coverdale, a month or two ago.</line>
        <line>But, as you have really a heart and sympathies, as far as they go, and</line>
        <line>as I shall depart without seeing Hollingsworth, I must entreat you to</line>
        <line>be a messenger between him and me."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Willingly," said I, wondering at the strange way in which her mind</line>
        <line>seemed to vibrate from the deepest earnest to mere levity. "What is</line>
        <line>the message?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"True,--what is it?" exclaimed Zenobia. "After all, I hardly know. On</line>
        <line>better consideration, I have no message. Tell him,--tell him something</line>
        <line>pretty and pathetic, that will come nicely and sweetly into your</line>
        <line>ballad,--anything you please, so it be tender and submissive enough.</line>
        <line>Tell him he has murdered me! Tell him that I'll haunt him! "--She</line>
        <line>spoke these words with the wildest energy.--"And give him--no, give</line>
        <line>Priscilla--this!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Thus saying, she took the jewelled flower out of her hair; and it</line>
        <line>struck me as the act of a queen, when worsted in a combat, discrowning</line>
        <line>herself, as if she found a sort of relief in abasing all her pride.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Bid her wear this for Zenobia's sake," she continued. "She is a</line>
        <line>pretty little creature, and will make as soft and gentle a wife as the</line>
        <line>veriest Bluebeard could desire. Pity that she must fade so soon! These</line>
        <line>delicate and puny maidens always do. Ten years hence, let</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth look at my face and Priscilla's, and then choose betwixt</line>
        <line>them. Or, if he pleases, let him do it now."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>How magnificently Zenobia looked as she said this! The effect of her</line>
        <line>beauty was even heightened by the over-consciousness and</line>
        <line>self-recognition of it, into which, I suppose, Hollingsworth's scorn</line>
        <line>had driven her. She understood the look of admiration in my face;</line>
        <line>and--Zenobia to the last--it gave her pleasure.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It is an endless pity," said she, "that I had not bethought myself of</line>
        <line>winning your heart, Mr. Coverdale, instead of Hollingsworth's. I think</line>
        <line>I should have succeeded, and many women would have deemed you the</line>
        <line>worthier conquest of the two. You are certainly much the handsomest</line>
        <line>man. But there is a fate in these things. And beauty, in a man, has</line>
        <line>been of little account with me since my earliest girlhood, when, for</line>
        <line>once, it turned my head. Now, farewell!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Zenobia, whither are you going?" I asked.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No matter where," said she. "But I am weary of this place, and sick</line>
        <line>to death of playing at philanthropy and progress. Of all varieties of</line>
        <line>mock-life, we have surely blundered into the very emptiest mockery in</line>
        <line>our effort to establish the one true system. I have done with it; and</line>
        <line>Blithedale must find another woman to superintend the laundry, and you,</line>
        <line>Mr. Coverdale, another nurse to make your gruel, the next time you fall</line>
        <line>ill. It was, indeed, a foolish dream! Yet it gave us some pleasant</line>
        <line>summer days, and bright hopes, while they lasted. It can do no more;</line>
        <line>nor will it avail us to shed tears over a broken bubble. Here is my</line>
        <line>hand! Adieu!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She gave me her hand with the same free, whole-souled gesture as on the</line>
        <line>first afternoon of our acquaintance, and, being greatly moved, I</line>
        <line>bethought me of no better method of expressing my deep sympathy than to</line>
        <line>carry it to my lips. In so doing, I perceived that this white hand--so</line>
        <line>hospitably warm when I first touched it, five months since--was now</line>
        <line>cold as a veritable piece of snow.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"How very cold!" I exclaimed, holding it between both my own, with the</line>
        <line>vain idea of warming it. "What can be the reason? It is really</line>
        <line>deathlike!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"The extremities die first, they say," answered Zenobia, laughing. "And</line>
        <line>so you kiss this poor, despised, rejected hand! Well, my dear friend,</line>
        <line>I thank you. You have reserved your homage for the fallen. Lip of man</line>
        <line>will never touch my hand again. I intend to become a Catholic, for the</line>
        <line>sake of going into a nunnery. When you next hear of Zenobia, her face</line>
        <line>will be behind the black veil; so look your last at it now,--for all is</line>
        <line>over. Once more, farewell!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She withdrew her hand, yet left a lingering pressure, which I felt long</line>
        <line>afterwards. So intimately connected as I had been with perhaps the</line>
        <line>only man in whom she was ever truly interested, Zenobia looked on me as</line>
        <line>the representative of all the past, and was conscious that, in bidding</line>
        <line>me adieu, she likewise took final leave of Hollingsworth, and of this</line>
        <line>whole epoch of her life. Never did her beauty shine out more</line>
        <line>lustrously than in the last glimpse that I had of her. She departed,</line>
        <line>and was soon hidden among the trees. But, whether it was the strong</line>
        <line>impression of the foregoing scene, or whatever else the cause, I was</line>
        <line>affected with a fantasy that Zenobia had not actually gone, but was</line>
        <line>still hovering about the spot and haunting it. I seemed to feel her</line>
        <line>eyes upon me. It was as if the vivid coloring of her character had</line>
        <line>left a brilliant stain upon the air. By degrees, however, the</line>
        <line>impression grew less distinct. I flung myself upon the fallen leaves</line>
        <line>at the base of Eliot's pulpit. The sunshine withdrew up the tree</line>
        <line>trunks and flickered on the topmost boughs; gray twilight made the wood</line>
        <line>obscure; the stars brightened out; the pendent boughs became wet with</line>
        <line>chill autumnal dews. But I was listless, worn out with emotion on my</line>
        <line>own behalf and sympathy for others, and had no heart to leave my</line>
        <line>comfortless lair beneath the rock.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I must have fallen asleep, and had a dream, all the circumstances of</line>
        <line>which utterly vanished at the moment when they converged to some</line>
        <line>tragical catastrophe, and thus grew too powerful for the thin sphere of</line>
        <line>slumber that enveloped them. Starting from the ground, I found the</line>
        <line>risen moon shining upon the rugged face of the rock, and myself all in</line>
        <line>a tremble.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>MIDNIGHT</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It could not have been far from midnight when I came beneath</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's window, and, finding it open, flung in a tuft of grass</line>
        <line>with earth at the roots, and heard it fall upon the floor. He was</line>
        <line>either awake or sleeping very lightly; for scarcely a moment had gone</line>
        <line>by before he looked out and discerned me standing in the moonlight.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Is it you, Coverdale?" he asked. "What is the matter?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Come down to me, Hollingsworth!" I answered. "I am anxious to speak</line>
        <line>with you."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The strange tone of my own voice startled me, and him, probably, no</line>
        <line>less. He lost no time, and soon issued from the house-door, with his</line>
        <line>dress half arranged.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Again, what is the matter?" he asked impatiently.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Have you seen Zenobia," said I, "since you parted from her at Eliot's</line>
        <line>pulpit?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No," answered Hollingsworth; "nor did I expect it."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>His voice was deep, but had a tremor in it,</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hardly had he spoken, when Silas Foster thrust his head, done up in a</line>
        <line>cotton handkerchief, out of another window, and took what he called as</line>
        <line>it literally was--a squint at us.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, folks, what are ye about here?" he demanded. "Aha! are you</line>
        <line>there, Miles Coverdale? You have been turning night into day since you</line>
        <line>left us, I reckon; and so you find it quite natural to come prowling</line>
        <line>about the house at this time o' night, frightening my old woman out of</line>
        <line>her wits, and making her disturb a tired man out of his best nap. In</line>
        <line>with you, you vagabond, and to bed!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Dress yourself quickly, Foster," said "We want your assistance."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I could not, for the life of me, keep that strange tone out of my</line>
        <line>voice. Silas Foster, obtuse as were his sensibilities, seemed to feel</line>
        <line>the ghastly earnestness that was conveyed in it as well as</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth did. He immediately withdrew his head, and I heard him</line>
        <line>yawning, muttering to his wife, and again yawning heavily, while he</line>
        <line>hurried on his clothes. Meanwhile I showed Hollingsworth a delicate</line>
        <line>handkerchief, marked with a well-known cipher, and told where I had</line>
        <line>found it, and other circumstances, which had filled me with a suspicion</line>
        <line>so terrible that I left him, if he dared, to shape it out for himself.</line>
        <line>By the time my brief explanation was finished, we were joined by Silas</line>
        <line>Foster in his blue woollen frock.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, boys," cried he peevishly, "what is to pay now?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Tell him, Hollingsworth," said I.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hollingsworth shivered perceptibly, and drew in a hard breath betwixt</line>
        <line>his teeth. He steadied himself, however, and, looking the matter more</line>
        <line>firmly in the face than I had done, explained to Foster my suspicions,</line>
        <line>and the grounds of them, with a distinctness from which, in spite of my</line>
        <line>utmost efforts, my words had swerved aside. The tough-nerved yeoman,</line>
        <line>in his comment, put a finish on the business, and brought out the</line>
        <line>hideous idea in its full terror, as if he were removing the napkin from</line>
        <line>the face of a corpse.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"And so you think she's drowned herself?" he cried. I turned away my</line>
        <line>face.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What on earth should the young woman do that for?" exclaimed Silas,</line>
        <line>his eyes half out of his head with mere surprise. "Why, she has more</line>
        <line>means than she can use or waste, and lacks nothing to make her</line>
        <line>comfortable, but a husband, and that's an article she could have, any</line>
        <line>day. There's some mistake about this, I tell you!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Come," said I, shuddering; "let us go and ascertain the truth."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, well," answered Silas Foster; "just as you say. We'll take the</line>
        <line>long pole, with the hook at the end, that serves to get the bucket out</line>
        <line>of the draw-well when the rope is broken. With that, and a couple of</line>
        <line>long-handled hay-rakes, I'll answer for finding her, if she's anywhere</line>
        <line>to be found. Strange enough! Zenobia drown herself! No, no; I don't</line>
        <line>believe it. She had too much sense, and too much means, and enjoyed</line>
        <line>life a great deal too well."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>When our few preparations were completed, we hastened, by a shorter</line>
        <line>than the customary route, through fields and pastures, and across a</line>
        <line>portion of the meadow, to the particular spot on the river-bank which I</line>
        <line>had paused to contemplate in the course of my afternoon's ramble. A</line>
        <line>nameless presentiment had again drawn me thither, after leaving Eliot's</line>
        <line>pulpit. I showed my companions where I had found the handkerchief, and</line>
        <line>pointed to two or three footsteps, impressed into the clayey margin,</line>
        <line>and tending towards the water. Beneath its shallow verge, among the</line>
        <line>water-weeds, there were further traces, as yet unobliterated by the</line>
        <line>sluggish current, which was there almost at a standstill. Silas Foster</line>
        <line>thrust his face down close to these footsteps, and picked up a shoe</line>
        <line>that had escaped my observation, being half imbedded in the mud.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"There's a kid shoe that never was made on a Yankee last," observed he.</line>
        <line>"I know enough of shoemaker's craft to tell that. French manufacture;</line>
        <line>and see what a high instep! and how evenly she trod in it! There never</line>
        <line>was a woman that stept handsomer in her shoes than Zenobia did. Here,"</line>
        <line>he added, addressing Hollingsworth, "would you like to keep the shoe?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Hollingsworth started back.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Give it to me, Foster," said I.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I dabbled it in the water, to rinse off the mud, and have kept it ever</line>
        <line>since. Not far from this spot lay an old, leaky punt, drawn up on the</line>
        <line>oozy river-side, and generally half full of water. It served the</line>
        <line>angler to go in quest of pickerel, or the sportsman to pick up his wild</line>
        <line>ducks. Setting this crazy bark afloat, I seated myself in the stern</line>
        <line>with the paddle, while Hollingsworth sat in the bows with the hooked</line>
        <line>pole, and Silas Foster amidships with a hay-rake.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It puts me in mind of my young days," remarked Silas, "when I used to</line>
        <line>steal out of bed to go bobbing for hornpouts and eels.</line>
        <line>Heigh-ho!--well, life and death together make sad work for us all!</line>
        <line>Then I was a boy, bobbing for fish; and now I am getting to be an old</line>
        <line>fellow, and here I be, groping for a dead body! I tell you what, lads;</line>
        <line>if I thought anything had really happened to Zenobia, I should feel</line>
        <line>kind o' sorrowful."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I wish, at least, you would hold your tongue," muttered I.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The moon, that night, though past the full, was still large and oval,</line>
        <line>and having risen between eight and nine o'clock, now shone aslantwise</line>
        <line>over the river, throwing the high, opposite bank, with its woods, into</line>
        <line>deep shadow, but lighting up the hither shore pretty effectually. Not a</line>
        <line>ray appeared to fall on the river itself. It lapsed imperceptibly</line>
        <line>away, a broad, black, inscrutable depth, keeping its own secrets from</line>
        <line>the eye of man, as impenetrably as mid-ocean could.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Well, Miles Coverdale," said Foster, "you are the helmsman. How do</line>
        <line>you mean to manage this business?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I shall let the boat drift, broadside foremost, past that stump," I</line>
        <line>replied. "I know the bottom, having sounded it in fishing. The shore,</line>
        <line>on this side, after the first step or two, goes off very abruptly; and</line>
        <line>there is a pool, just by the stump, twelve or fifteen feet deep. The</line>
        <line>current could not have force enough to sweep any sunken object, even if</line>
        <line>partially buoyant, out of that hollow."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Come, then," said Silas; "but I doubt whether I can touch bottom with</line>
        <line>this hay-rake, if it's as deep as you say. Mr. Hollingsworth, I think</line>
        <line>you'll be the lucky man to-night, such luck as it is."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>We floated past the stump. Silas Foster plied his rake manfully,</line>
        <line>poking it as far as he could into the water, and immersing the whole</line>
        <line>length of his arm besides. Hollingsworth at first sat motionless, with</line>
        <line>the hooked pole elevated in the air. But, by and by, with a nervous</line>
        <line>and jerky movement, he began to plunge it into the blackness that</line>
        <line>upbore us, setting his teeth, and making precisely such thrusts,</line>
        <line>methought, as if he were stabbing at a deadly enemy. I bent over the</line>
        <line>side of the boat. So obscure, however, so awfully mysterious, was that</line>
        <line>dark stream, that--and the thought made me shiver like a leaf--I might</line>
        <line>as well have tried to look into the enigma of the eternal world, to</line>
        <line>discover what had become of Zenobia's soul, as into the river's depths,</line>
        <line>to find her body. And there, perhaps, she lay, with her face upward,</line>
        <line>while the shadow of the boat, and my own pale face peering downward,</line>
        <line>passed slowly betwixt her and the sky!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Once, twice, thrice, I paddled the boat upstream, and again suffered it</line>
        <line>to glide, with the river's slow, funereal motion, downward. Silas</line>
        <line>Foster had raked up a large mass of stuff, which, as it came towards</line>
        <line>the surface, looked somewhat like a flowing garment, but proved to be a</line>
        <line>monstrous tuft of water-weeds. Hollingsworth, with a gigantic effort,</line>
        <line>upheaved a sunken log. When once free of the bottom, it rose partly</line>
        <line>out of water,--all weedy and slimy, a devilish-looking object, which</line>
        <line>the moon had not shone upon for half a hundred years,--then plunged</line>
        <line>again, and sullenly returned to its old resting-place, for the remnant</line>
        <line>of the century.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"That looked ugly!" quoth Silas. "I half thought it was the Evil One,</line>
        <line>on the same errand as ourselves,--searching for Zenobia."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"He shall never get her," said I, giving the boat a strong impulse.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"That's not for you to say, my boy," retorted the yeoman. "Pray God he</line>
        <line>never has, and never may. Slow work this, however! I should really be</line>
        <line>glad to find something! Pshaw! What a notion that is, when the only</line>
        <line>good luck would be to paddle, and drift, and poke, and grope,</line>
        <line>hereabouts, till morning, and have our labor for our pains! For my</line>
        <line>part, I shouldn't wonder if the creature had only lost her shoe in the</line>
        <line>mud, and saved her soul alive, after all. My stars! how she will laugh</line>
        <line>at us, to-morrow morning!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It is indescribable what an image of Zenobia--at the breakfast-table,</line>
        <line>full of warm and mirthful life--this surmise of Silas Foster's brought</line>
        <line>before my mind. The terrible phantasm of her death was thrown by it</line>
        <line>into the remotest and dimmest background, where it seemed to grow as</line>
        <line>improbable as a myth.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Yes, Silas, it may be as you say," cried The drift of the stream</line>
        <line>had again borne us a little below the stump, when I felt--yes, felt,</line>
        <line>for it was as if the iron hook had smote my breast--felt</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's pole strike some object at the bottom of the river!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>He started up, and almost overset the boat.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Hold on!" cried Foster; "you have her!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Putting a fury of strength into the effort, Hollingsworth heaved amain,</line>
        <line>and up came a white swash to the surface of the river. It was the flow</line>
        <line>of a woman's garments. A little higher, and we saw her dark hair</line>
        <line>streaming down the current. Black River of Death, thou hadst yielded</line>
        <line>up thy victim! Zenobia was found!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Silas Foster laid hold of the body; Hollingsworth likewise grappled</line>
        <line>with it; and I steered towards the bank, gazing all the while at</line>
        <line>Zenobia, whose limbs were swaying in the current close at the boat's</line>
        <line>side. Arriving near the shore, we all three stept into the water, bore</line>
        <line>her out, and laid her on the ground beneath a tree.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Poor child!" said Foster,--and his dry old heart, I verily believe,</line>
        <line>vouchsafed a tear, "I'm sorry for her!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Were I to describe the perfect horror of the spectacle, the reader</line>
        <line>might justly reckon it to me for a sin and shame. For more than twelve</line>
        <line>long years I have borne it in my memory, and could now reproduce it as</line>
        <line>freshly as if it were still before my eyes. Of all modes of death,</line>
        <line>methinks it is the ugliest. Her wet garments swathed limbs of terrible</line>
        <line>inflexibility. She was the marble image of a death-agony. Her arms</line>
        <line>had grown rigid in the act of struggling, and were bent before her with</line>
        <line>clenched hands; her knees, too, were bent, and--thank God for it!--in</line>
        <line>the attitude of prayer. Ah, that rigidity! It is impossible to bear</line>
        <line>the terror of it. It seemed,--I must needs impart so much of my own</line>
        <line>miserable idea,--it seemed as if her body must keep the same position</line>
        <line>in the coffin, and that her skeleton would keep it in the grave; and</line>
        <line>that when Zenobia rose at the day of judgment, it would be in just the</line>
        <line>same attitude as now!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>One hope I had, and that too was mingled half with fear. She knelt as</line>
        <line>if in prayer. With the last, choking consciousness, her soul, bubbling</line>
        <line>out through her lips, it may be, had given itself up to the Father,</line>
        <line>reconciled and penitent. But her arms! They were bent before her, as</line>
        <line>if she struggled against Providence in never-ending hostility. Her</line>
        <line>hands! They were clenched in immitigable defiance. Away with the</line>
        <line>hideous thought. The flitting moment after Zenobia sank into the dark</line>
        <line>pool--when her breath was gone, and her soul at her lips was as long,</line>
        <line>in its capacity of God's infinite forgiveness, as the lifetime of the</line>
        <line>world!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Foster bent over the body, and carefully examined it.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You have wounded the poor thing's breast," said he to Hollingsworth,</line>
        <line>"close by her heart, too!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Ha!" cried Hollingsworth with a start.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>And so he had, indeed, both before and after death!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"See!" said Foster. "That's the place where the iron struck her. It</line>
        <line>looks cruelly, but she never felt it!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>He endeavored to arrange the arms of the corpse decently by its side.</line>
        <line>His utmost strength, however, scarcely sufficed to bring them down; and</line>
        <line>rising again, the next instant, they bade him defiance, exactly as</line>
        <line>before. He made another effort, with the same result.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"In God's name, Silas Foster," cried I with bitter indignation, "let</line>
        <line>that dead woman alone!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Why, man, it's not decent!" answered he, staring at me in amazement.</line>
        <line>"I can't bear to see her looking so! Well, well," added he, after a</line>
        <line>third effort, "'tis of no use, sure enough; and we must leave the women</line>
        <line>to do their best with her, after we get to the house. The sooner</line>
        <line>that's done, the better."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>We took two rails from a neighboring fence, and formed a bier by laying</line>
        <line>across some boards from the bottom of the boat. And thus we bore</line>
        <line>Zenobia homeward. Six hours before, how beautiful! At midnight, what</line>
        <line>a horror! A reflection occurs to me that will show ludicrously, I</line>
        <line>doubt not, on my page, but must come in for its sterling truth. Being</line>
        <line>the woman that she was, could Zenobia have foreseen all these ugly</line>
        <line>circumstances of death,--how ill it would become her, the altogether</line>
        <line>unseemly aspect which she must put on, and especially old Silas</line>
        <line>Foster's efforts to improve the matter,--she would no more have</line>
        <line>committed the dreadful act than have exhibited herself to a public</line>
        <line>assembly in a badly fitting garment! Zenobia, I have often thought,</line>
        <line>was not quite simple in her death. She had seen pictures, I suppose,</line>
        <line>of drowned persons in lithe and graceful attitudes. And she deemed it</line>
        <line>well and decorous to die as so many village maidens have, wronged in</line>
        <line>their first love, and seeking peace in the bosom of the old familiar</line>
        <line>stream,--so familiar that they could not dread it,--where, in</line>
        <line>childhood, they used to bathe their little feet, wading mid-leg deep,</line>
        <line>unmindful of wet skirts. But in Zenobia's case there was some tint of</line>
        <line>the Arcadian affectation that had been visible enough in all our lives</line>
        <line>for a few months past.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>This, however, to my conception, takes nothing from the tragedy. For,</line>
        <line>has not the world come to an awfully sophisticated pass, when, after a</line>
        <line>certain degree of acquaintance with it, we cannot even put ourselves to</line>
        <line>death in whole-hearted simplicity? Slowly, slowly, with many a dreary</line>
        <line>pause,--resting the bier often on some rock or balancing it across a</line>
        <line>mossy log, to take fresh hold,--we bore our burden onward through the</line>
        <line>moonlight, and at last laid Zenobia on the floor of the old farmhouse.</line>
        <line>By and by came three or four withered women and stood whispering around</line>
        <line>the corpse, peering at it through their spectacles, holding up their</line>
        <line>skinny hands, shaking their night-capped heads, and taking counsel of</line>
        <line>one another's experience what was to be done.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>With those tire-women we left Zenobia.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>BLITHEDALE PASTURE</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Blithedale, thus far in its progress, had never found the necessity of</line>
        <line>a burial-ground. There was some consultation among us in what spot</line>
        <line>Zenobia might most fitly be laid. It was my own wish that she should</line>
        <line>sleep at the base of Eliot's pulpit, and that on the rugged front of</line>
        <line>the rock the name by which we familiarly knew her, Zenobia,--and not</line>
        <line>another word, should be deeply cut, and left for the moss and lichens</line>
        <line>to fill up at their long leisure. But Hollingsworth (to whose ideas on</line>
        <line>this point great deference was due) made it his request that her grave</line>
        <line>might be dug on the gently sloping hillside, in the wide pasture,</line>
        <line>where, as we once supposed, Zenobia and he had planned to build their</line>
        <line>cottage. And thus it was done, accordingly.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>She was buried very much as other people have been for hundreds of</line>
        <line>years gone by. In anticipation of a death, we Blithedale colonists had</line>
        <line>sometimes set our fancies at work to arrange a funereal ceremony, which</line>
        <line>should be the proper symbolic expression of our spiritual faith and</line>
        <line>eternal hopes; and this we meant to substitute for those customary</line>
        <line>rites which were moulded originally out of the Gothic gloom, and by</line>
        <line>long use, like an old velvet pall, have so much more than their first</line>
        <line>death-smell in them. But when the occasion came we found it the</line>
        <line>simplest and truest thing, after all, to content ourselves with the old</line>
        <line>fashion, taking away what we could, but interpolating no novelties, and</line>
        <line>particularly avoiding all frippery of flowers and cheerful emblems.</line>
        <line>The procession moved from the farmhouse. Nearest the dead walked an</line>
        <line>old man in deep mourning, his face mostly concealed in a white</line>
        <line>handkerchief, and with Priscilla leaning on his arm. Hollingsworth and</line>
        <line>myself came next. We all stood around the narrow niche in the cold</line>
        <line>earth; all saw the coffin lowered in; all heard the rattle of the</line>
        <line>crumbly soil upon its lid,--that final sound, which mortality awakens</line>
        <line>on the utmost verge of sense, as if in the vain hope of bringing an</line>
        <line>echo from the spiritual world.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I noticed a stranger,--a stranger to most of those present, though</line>
        <line>known to me,--who, after the coffin had descended, took up a handful of</line>
        <line>earth and flung it first into the grave. I had given up</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's arm, and now found myself near this man.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"It was an idle thing--a foolish thing--for Zenobia to do," said he.</line>
        <line>"She was the last woman in the world to whom death could have been</line>
        <line>necessary. It was too absurd! I have no patience with her."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Why so?" I inquired, smothering my horror at his cold comment, in my</line>
        <line>eager curiosity to discover some tangible truth as to his relation with</line>
        <line>Zenobia. "If any crisis could justify the sad wrong she offered to</line>
        <line>herself, it was surely that in which she stood. Everything had failed</line>
        <line>her; prosperity in the world's sense, for her opulence was gone,--the</line>
        <line>heart's prosperity, in love. And there was a secret burden on her, the</line>
        <line>nature of which is best known to you. Young as she was, she had tried</line>
        <line>life fully, had no more to hope, and something, perhaps, to fear. Had</line>
        <line>Providence taken her away in its own holy hand, I should have thought</line>
        <line>it the kindest dispensation that could be awarded to one so wrecked."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"You mistake the matter completely," rejoined Westervelt.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"What, then, is your own view of it?" I asked.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Her mind was active, and various in its powers," said he. "Her heart</line>
        <line>had a manifold adaptation; her constitution an infinite buoyancy, which</line>
        <line>(had she possessed only a little patience to await the reflux of her</line>
        <line>troubles) would have borne her upward triumphantly for twenty years to</line>
        <line>come. Her beauty would not have waned--or scarcely so, and surely not</line>
        <line>beyond the reach of art to restore it--in all that time. She had</line>
        <line>life's summer all before her, and a hundred varieties of brilliant</line>
        <line>success. What an actress Zenobia might have been! It was one of her</line>
        <line>least valuable capabilities. How forcibly she might have wrought upon</line>
        <line>the world, either directly in her own person, or by her influence upon</line>
        <line>some man, or a series of men, of controlling genius! Every prize that</line>
        <line>could be worth a woman's having--and many prizes which other women are</line>
        <line>too timid to desire--lay within Zenobia's reach."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"In all this," I observed, "there would have been nothing to satisfy</line>
        <line>her heart."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Her heart!" answered Westervelt contemptuously. "That troublesome</line>
        <line>organ (as she had hitherto found it) would have been kept in its due</line>
        <line>place and degree, and have had all the gratification it could fairly</line>
        <line>claim. She would soon have established a control over it. Love had</line>
        <line>failed her, you say. Had it never failed her before? Yet she survived</line>
        <line>it, and loved again,--possibly not once alone, nor twice either. And</line>
        <line>now to drown herself for yonder dreamy philanthropist!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Who are you," I exclaimed indignantly, "that dare to speak thus of the</line>
        <line>dead? You seem to intend a eulogy, yet leave out whatever was noblest</line>
        <line>in her, and blacken while you mean to praise. I have long considered</line>
        <line>you as Zenobia's evil fate. Your sentiments confirm me in the idea,</line>
        <line>but leave me still ignorant as to the mode in which you have influenced</line>
        <line>her life. The connection may have been indissoluble, except by death.</line>
        <line>Then, indeed,--always in the hope of God's infinite mercy,--I cannot</line>
        <line>deem it a misfortune that she sleeps in yonder grave!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No matter what I was to her," he answered gloomily, yet without actual</line>
        <line>emotion. "She is now beyond my reach. Had she lived, and hearkened to</line>
        <line>my counsels, we might have served each other well. But there Zenobia</line>
        <line>lies in yonder pit, with the dull earth over her. Twenty years of a</line>
        <line>brilliant lifetime thrown away for a mere woman's whim!"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Heaven deal with Westervelt according to his nature and deserts!--that</line>
        <line>is to say, annihilate him. He was altogether earthy, worldly, made for</line>
        <line>time and its gross objects, and incapable--except by a sort of dim</line>
        <line>reflection caught from other minds--of so much as one spiritual idea.</line>
        <line>Whatever stain Zenobia had was caught from him; nor does it seldom</line>
        <line>happen that a character of admirable qualities loses its better life</line>
        <line>because the atmosphere that should sustain it is rendered poisonous by</line>
        <line>such breath as this man mingled with Zenobia's. Yet his reflections</line>
        <line>possessed their share of truth. It was a woeful thought, that a woman</line>
        <line>of Zenobia's diversified capacity should have fancied herself</line>
        <line>irretrievably defeated on the broad battlefield of life, and with no</line>
        <line>refuge, save to fall on her own sword, merely because Love had gone</line>
        <line>against her. It is nonsense, and a miserable wrong,--the result, like</line>
        <line>so many others, of masculine egotism,--that the success or failure of</line>
        <line>woman's existence should be made to depend wholly on the affections,</line>
        <line>and on one species of affection, while man has such a multitude of</line>
        <line>other chances, that this seems but an incident. For its own sake, if</line>
        <line>it will do no more, the world should throw open all its avenues to the</line>
        <line>passport of a woman's bleeding heart.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>As we stood around the grave, I looked often towards Priscilla,</line>
        <line>dreading to see her wholly overcome with grief. And deeply grieved, in</line>
        <line>truth, she was. But a character so simply constituted as hers has room</line>
        <line>only for a single predominant affection. No other feeling can touch</line>
        <line>the heart's inmost core, nor do it any deadly mischief. Thus, while we</line>
        <line>see that such a being responds to every breeze with tremulous</line>
        <line>vibration, and imagine that she must be shattered by the first rude</line>
        <line>blast, we find her retaining her equilibrium amid shocks that might</line>
        <line>have overthrown many a sturdier frame. So with Priscilla; her one</line>
        <line>possible misfortune was Hollingsworth's unkindness; and that was</line>
        <line>destined never to befall her, never yet, at least, for Priscilla has</line>
        <line>not died.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But Hollingsworth! After all the evil that he did, are we to leave him</line>
        <line>thus, blest with the entire devotion of this one true heart, and with</line>
        <line>wealth at his disposal to execute the long-contemplated project that</line>
        <line>had led him so far astray? What retribution is there here? My mind</line>
        <line>being vexed with precisely this query, I made a journey, some years</line>
        <line>since, for the sole purpose of catching a last glimpse of</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth, and judging for myself whether he were a happy man or</line>
        <line>no. I learned that he inhabited a small cottage, that his way of life</line>
        <line>was exceedingly retired, and that my only chance of encountering him or</line>
        <line>Priscilla was to meet them in a secluded lane, where, in the latter</line>
        <line>part of the afternoon, they were accustomed to walk. I did meet them,</line>
        <line>accordingly. As they approached me, I observed in Hollingsworth's face</line>
        <line>a depressed and melancholy look, that seemed habitual; the powerfully</line>
        <line>built man showed a self-distrustful weakness, and a childlike or</line>
        <line>childish tendency to press close, and closer still, to the side of the</line>
        <line>slender woman whose arm was within his. In Priscilla's manner there</line>
        <line>was a protective and watchful quality, as if she felt herself the</line>
        <line>guardian of her companion; but, likewise, a deep, submissive,</line>
        <line>unquestioning reverence, and also a veiled happiness in her fair and</line>
        <line>quiet countenance.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Drawing nearer, Priscilla recognized me, and gave me a kind and</line>
        <line>friendly smile, but with a slight gesture, which I could not help</line>
        <line>interpreting as an entreaty not to make myself known to Hollingsworth.</line>
        <line>Nevertheless, an impulse took possession of me, and compelled me to</line>
        <line>address him.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"I have come, Hollingsworth," said I, "to view your grand edifice for</line>
        <line>the reformation of criminals. Is it finished yet?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"No, nor begun," answered he, without raising his eyes. "A very small</line>
        <line>one answers all my purposes."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Priscilla threw me an upbraiding glance. But I spoke again, with a</line>
        <line>bitter and revengeful emotion, as if flinging a poisoned arrow at</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's heart.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Up to this moment," I inquired, "how many criminals have you reformed?"</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>"Not one," said Hollingsworth, with his eyes still fixed on the ground.</line>
        <line>"Ever since we parted, I have been busy with a single murderer."</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>Then the tears gushed into my eyes, and I forgave him; for I remembered</line>
        <line>the wild energy, the passionate shriek, with which Zenobia had spoken</line>
        <line>those words, "Tell him he has murdered me! Tell him that I'll haunt</line>
        <line>him!"--and I knew what murderer he meant, and whose vindictive shadow</line>
        <line>dogged the side where Priscilla was not.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>The moral which presents itself to my reflections, as drawn from</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth's character and errors, is simply this, that, admitting</line>
        <line>what is called philanthropy, when adopted as a profession, to be often</line>
        <line>useful by its energetic impulse to society at large, it is perilous to</line>
        <line>the individual whose ruling passion, in one exclusive channel, it thus</line>
        <line>becomes. It ruins, or is fearfully apt to ruin, the heart, the rich</line>
        <line>juices of which God never meant should be pressed violently out and</line>
        <line>distilled into alcoholic liquor by an unnatural process, but should</line>
        <line>render life sweet, bland, and gently beneficent, and insensibly</line>
        <line>influence other hearts and other lives to the same blessed end. I see</line>
        <line>in Hollingsworth an exemplification of the most awful truth in Bunyan's</line>
        <line>book of such, from the very gate of heaven there is a by-way to the pit!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But, all this while, we have been standing by Zenobia's grave. I have</line>
        <line>never since beheld it, but make no question that the grass grew all the</line>
        <line>better, on that little parallelogram of pasture land, for the decay of</line>
        <line>the beautiful woman who slept beneath. How Nature seems to love us!</line>
        <line>And how readily, nevertheless, without a sigh or a complaint, she</line>
        <line>converts us to a meaner purpose, when her highest one--that of a</line>
        <line>conscious intellectual life and sensibility has been untimely balked!</line>
        <line>While Zenobia lived, Nature was proud of her, and directed all eyes</line>
        <line>upon that radiant presence, as her fairest handiwork. Zenobia</line>
        <line>perished. Will not Nature shed a tear? Ah, no!--she adopts the</line>
        <line>calamity at once into her system, and is just as well pleased, for</line>
        <line>aught we can see, with the tuft of ranker vegetation that grew out of</line>
        <line>Zenobia's heart, as with all the beauty which has bequeathed us no</line>
        <line>earthly representative except in this crop of weeds. It is because the</line>
        <line>spirit is inestimable that the lifeless body is so little valued.</line>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>
        <title>MILES COVERDALE'S CONFESSION</title>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>It remains only to say a few words about myself. Not improbably, the</line>
        <line>reader might be willing to spare me the trouble; for I have made but a</line>
        <line>poor and dim figure in my own narrative, establishing no separate</line>
        <line>interest, and suffering my colorless life to take its hue from other</line>
        <line>lives. But one still retains some little consideration for one's self;</line>
        <line>so I keep these last two or three pages for my individual and sole</line>
        <line>behoof.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>But what, after all, have I to tell? Nothing, nothing, nothing! I</line>
        <line>left Blithedale within the week after Zenobia's death, and went back</line>
        <line>thither no more. The whole soil of our farm, for a long time</line>
        <line>afterwards, seemed but the sodded earth over her grave. I could not</line>
        <line>toil there, nor live upon its products. Often, however, in these years</line>
        <line>that are darkening around me, I remember our beautiful scheme of a</line>
        <line>noble and unselfish life; and how fair, in that first summer, appeared</line>
        <line>the prospect that it might endure for generations, and be perfected, as</line>
        <line>the ages rolled away, into the system of a people and a world! Were my</line>
        <line>former associates now there,--were there only three or four of those</line>
        <line>true-hearted men still laboring in the sun,--I sometimes fancy that I</line>
        <line>should direct my world-weary footsteps thitherward, and entreat them to</line>
        <line>receive me, for old friendship's sake. More and more I feel that we</line>
        <line>had struck upon what ought to be a truth. Posterity may dig it up, and</line>
        <line>profit by it. The experiment, so far as its original projectors were</line>
        <line>concerned, proved, long ago, a failure; first lapsing into Fourierism,</line>
        <line>and dying, as it well deserved, for this infidelity to its own higher</line>
        <line>spirit. Where once we toiled with our whole hopeful hearts, the town</line>
        <line>paupers, aged, nerveless, and disconsolate, creep sluggishly afield.</line>
        <line>Alas, what faith is requisite to bear up against such results of</line>
        <line>generous effort!</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>My subsequent life has passed,--I was going to say happily, but, at all</line>
        <line>events, tolerably enough. I am now at middle age, well, well, a step</line>
        <line>or two beyond the midmost point, and I care not a fig who knows it!--a</line>
        <line>bachelor, with no very decided purpose of ever being otherwise. I have</line>
        <line>been twice to Europe, and spent a year or two rather agreeably at each</line>
        <line>visit. Being well to do in the world, and having nobody but myself to</line>
        <line>care for, I live very much at my ease, and fare sumptuously every day.</line>
        <line>As for poetry, I have given it up, notwithstanding that Dr.</line>
        <line>Griswold--as the reader, of course, knows--has placed me at a fair</line>
        <line>elevation among our minor minstrelsy, on the strength of my pretty</line>
        <line>little volume, published ten years ago. As regards human progress (in</line>
        <line>spite of my irrepressible yearnings over the Blithedale reminiscences),</line>
        <line>let them believe in it who can, and aid in it who choose. If I could</line>
        <line>earnestly do either, it might be all the better for my comfort. As</line>
        <line>Hollingsworth once told me, I lack a purpose. How strange! He was</line>
        <line>ruined, morally, by an overplus of the very same ingredient, the want</line>
        <line>of which, I occasionally suspect, has rendered my own life all an</line>
        <line>emptiness. I by no means wish to die. Yet, were there any cause, in</line>
        <line>this whole chaos of human struggle, worth a sane man's dying for, and</line>
        <line>which my death would benefit, then--provided, however, the effort did</line>
        <line>not involve an unreasonable amount of trouble--methinks I might be bold</line>
        <line>to offer up my life. If Kossuth, for example, would pitch the</line>
        <line>battlefield of Hungarian rights within an easy ride of my abode, and</line>
        <line>choose a mild, sunny morning, after breakfast, for the conflict, Miles</line>
        <line>Coverdale would gladly be his man, for one brave rush upon the levelled</line>
        <line>bayonets. Further than that, I should be loath to pledge myself.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I exaggerate my own defects. The reader must not take my own word for</line>
        <line>it, nor believe me altogether changed from the young man who once hoped</line>
        <line>strenuously, and struggled not so much amiss. Frostier heads than mine</line>
        <line>have gained honor in the world; frostier hearts have imbibed new</line>
        <line>warmth, and been newly happy. Life, however, it must be owned, has</line>
        <line>come to rather an idle pass with me. Would my friends like to know</line>
        <line>what brought it thither? There is one secret,--I have concealed it all</line>
        <line>along, and never meant to let the least whisper of it escape,--one</line>
        <line>foolish little secret, which possibly may have had something to do with</line>
        <line>these inactive years of meridian manhood, with my bachelorship, with</line>
        <line>the unsatisfied retrospect that I fling back on life, and my listless</line>
        <line>glance towards the future. Shall I reveal it? It is an absurd thing</line>
        <line>for a man in his afternoon,--a man of the world, moreover, with these</line>
        <line>three white hairs in his brown mustache and that deepening track of a</line>
        <line>crow's-foot on each temple,--an absurd thing ever to have happened, and</line>
        <line>quite the absurdest for an old bachelor, like me, to talk about. But</line>
        <line>it rises to my throat; so let it come.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I perceive, moreover, that the confession, brief as it shall be, will</line>
        <line>throw a gleam of light over my behavior throughout the foregoing</line>
        <line>incidents, and is, indeed, essential to the full understanding of my</line>
        <line>story. The reader, therefore, since I have disclosed so much, is</line>
        <line>entitled to this one word more. As I write it, he will charitably</line>
        <line>suppose me to blush, and turn away my face:</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I--I myself--was in love--with--Priscilla!</line>
