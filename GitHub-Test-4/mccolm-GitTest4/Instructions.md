# GitHub Test 4: Post some code to request feedback

This directory is here, in the `GitHub-Test-4` directory, to hold your files for **Part 4** of the GitHub Test. 
To proceed with completing this portion of the test:

1. Check what branch you are in on your local computer's clone of this textAnalysis-Hub.
1. Make your way to the main branch (if you are not already there) using the appropriate git commands. 
1. Use the appropriate git command to update the main branch and pull in this folder.
1. Then create a new branch (using the appropriate git command). Name the branch with your name, a hyphen, and GitTest4, like this: `ebeshero-GitTest4`
1. Save the code file you have written (according to the test instructions) into **this folder** (GitHub-Test-4-PyNLPDiscuss) in the repo. Your file should be one of your Python homework files from this NLP unit we're working on  and it should contain some lines of code and comments that are yours (not mine).

1. Push your branch to the remote repo and issue a new pull request asking someone from the class to merge your branch into the main branch.
