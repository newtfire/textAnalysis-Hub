Prompt: Can you please generate me a short horror story, preferably in a paragraph or less.

Result #1

Here is a short horror story in one paragraph:

I jolted awake to a tapping sound coming from the bedroom window. As I slowly opened my eyes and glanced toward the window, I saw a pale, gaunt face peering in, eyes sunken and hollow, fangs bared. My heart pounded as it scratched at the glass, staring directly at me. I wanted to scream but fear gripped me and kept me silent and frozen under the covers. The scratching became furious as the creature snarled hungrily from outside. Just when I thought the glass might shatter under its claws, the sun began to rise and the face slowly faded back into the darkness. I shuddered wondering if tonight I'd see that dead, hungry stare again at my window.

Result #2

Here's a short horror story in one paragraph:

I woke with a start, my heart pounding. The room was dark and eerily quiet. I reached for my phone to check the time, but it wasn't on my nightstand. A floorboard creaked outside my bedroom. I froze, listening intently. The doorknob slowly began to turn, the hinges squeaking ominously. I wanted to scream but terror seized my throat. As the door inched open, I saw a pale hand curl around the frame, long bony fingers with jagged nails grasping. Two dark hollows appeared where eyes should be in the gaunt face that peered around my door. Its lipless mouth opened revealing rows of sharp fang-like teeth parted in a gruesome smile as it wheezed, “I've been waiting for you.”

Result #3

Here is a short horror story in one paragraph:

I jolted awake to the sound of scratching at my bedroom door. I froze, listening intently as the scraping continued in irregular spurts - long, tortured drags interrupted by frantic flurries, like jagged nails raking the wood. My pulse pounded in my ears as I stared wide-eyed into the darkness. Whatever was on the other side seemed to be struggling to get in, its efforts growing more desperate, more frenzied. The door began to violently rattle in its frame until, with an awful crack, it flew open to reveal nothing but an empty hallway swallowed by shadows. Yet the scratching continued, now coming from directly behind me, inside the room.
