Here is a fictional article about Joe Biden defeating Adam Smasher in 2077:

In an epic showdown worthy of the history books, former U.S. President Joe Biden, at the incredible age of 135, managed to take down the ruthless cyborg Adam Smasher in Night City last Tuesday. 

The confrontation occurred outside of the Arasaka headquarters. Eyewitnesses say Smasher was rampaging through the city streets, unleashing missiles and wrecking anything in his path. Out of nowhere, the elder statesman Biden came flying in on his wheelchair, decked out in futuristic cyberpunk gear. 

"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Biden zooming around blasting Smasher with his arm laser cannons," said one bystander. "He was cracking jokes the whole time, taunting Smasher about his 'malarkey' even as he rained down blows on the cyborg."

The two battled intensely, firing techno-weapons and trading insults. Smasher seemed to underestimate the wheelchair-bound Biden, who dodged rockets and charged his massive foe head-on. After a lengthy clash, Biden managed to damage Smasher's systems enough to bring down the cybernetic titan.

Biden then wheeled over Smasher's twitching body and quipped, "You're fired, jack." The former president zoomed off victorious, welcomed by cheers from residents. At 135, Biden proved he can still throw down with the bestimplanted solos Night City has to offer, defending the city from one of its most notorious villains. His advanced age seems to have only toughened his resolve.
