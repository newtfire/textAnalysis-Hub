 Here is a short story set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe:

Night City Nights

The neon lights of Night City glowed brilliantly, lighting up the perpetual darkness that shrouded the streets. V walked briskly down the sidewalk, weaving between crowds of people immersed in the city's nightlife. She was on her way to Lizzie's Bar, one of her favorite spots in Watson district. 

As she approached the bar, the thumping bass of techno music echoed down the street. The bouncer, a hulking man with cybernetic arms, nodded in recognition as V approached. Inside, the dance floor was packed with writhing bodies, lit by strobing lights and holographic projections.

V slid into an open spot at the bar, raising a hand to get the bartender's attention. "Whiskey. Neat," she said, slapping a few eddies on the counter. As she waited for her drink, her gaze drifted around the room, taking in the sights. 

In the back corner, a dark-haired woman with glowing cybernetic implants was cheering on two men locked in an illegal deathmatch, their bodies kinetic with chrome reflexes and implant-enhanced muscles. On the dance floor, a young man swayed in time with the music, oblivious to the fact that his drink had been drugged by the scantily-clad woman behind him. 

Just another night in Night City, mused V as she knocked back her whiskey. She relished these pockets of shadow in the glittering dark. Night City wasn't an easy place to survive, but it was never boring.
