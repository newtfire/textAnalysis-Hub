Biden 2077

Joe Biden stepped out of his self-driving limo onto the neon-bathed streets of Night City. He was here on a diplomatic mission to meet with the newly elected Mayor, representing the interests of the New United Corporations of America. 

As he approached City Hall, he couldn't help but marvel at the towering megabuildings surrounding him. He'd never seen anything like the architectural marvels of Night City before. Back in Washington DC, buildings were limited to just a few stories by law. But here, technological innovation had enabled the construction of true megascrapers.

Walking through the grand entrance of City Hall, Biden was met by the Mayor's assistant, a young woman with bright pink hair and chrome cybernetic arms. 

"Mr. President, welcome to Night City. Mayor Weldon is ready to see you now," she said, leading him down a sleek hallway lined with holographic displays.

Inside the Mayor's office, Biden took a seat across from the Mayor, a wiry man with a stern gaze and a robotic left eye. After exchanging formalities, they got down to business, negotiating the terms of a new trade deal between their respective nations. 

With the talks going well, Biden couldn't help but feel optimistic about the future. Perhaps Night City would be the key to bringing economic prosperity back to America. The possibilities in this high-tech urban sprawl seemed endless.
