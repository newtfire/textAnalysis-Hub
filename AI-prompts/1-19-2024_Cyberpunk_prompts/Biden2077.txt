write a wikipedia article about Joe Biden as if he lived in the year 2077



Here is a hypothetical Wikipedia entry for Joe Biden in the year 2077:

Joe Biden (1942-2077) was an American politician who served as the 46th President of the United States from 2021 to 2029. He was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania and lived to the remarkable age of 135. 

After a long political career as a U.S. Senator from Delaware, Biden became Vice President under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017. He then launched his own successful presidential campaign in 2020, defeating incumbent President Donald Trump. 

As president, Biden passed major legislation to battle climate change, reform immigration, improve infrastructure, and expand health care. His presidency stabilized the nation after the chaos of the prior administration. However, Biden's advanced age led to questions about his mental fitness during his second term.

After leaving office in 2029 at the age of 87, Biden dedicated his retirement to philanthropic causes, particularly cancer research and care for the elderly. He witnessed great technological and social changes over his unusually long life. Biden died peacefully in his hometown of Scranton in the year 2077 at age 135, setting a record for the longest lived U.S. president. 

Biden is remembered as a steady and empathetic leader who helped mend a politically fractured nation. His longevity, possibly aided by scientific advances in healthy aging, allowed him to serve his country for decades and become one of the most influential figures of the early 21st century.
