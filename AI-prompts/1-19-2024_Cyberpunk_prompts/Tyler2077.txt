Tyler (2077)

Tyler (full name unknown) was a augmented mercenary active in Night City during the 2070s. He was affiliated with the band of mercenaries known as the Bloodhounds.

Early Life
Tyler's early life and origins remain unknown. It is believed he moved to Night City as a young man in the late 2050s or early 2060s. At some point he underwent significant augmentation, though the reasons and extent remain undisclosed.

Tyler was rumored to have extensive connections among Night City's criminal gangs and corporate leaders.  

Though a skilled marksman and stealth operative, Tyler's augmentations made him especially deadly in close quarters combat. His signature weapons included a monowire garrote and retractable cybernetic claws. Survivors of encounters with Tyler reported his movements were a "chrome blur". 

Affiliation with Bloodhounds

Disappearance 
In March of 2077, Tyler disappeared during a bloody gun battle with the Arasaka Corporation's counterintel forces at a warehouse in Watson District. His current status is unknown, though most presume he was killed. At the time of his disappearance, Tyler was considered among the most lethal solo mercenaries in Night City.  

Legacy
