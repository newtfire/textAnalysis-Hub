My dear fellow citizens,

I come before you today not as the President of the United States, but as a fellow human being, united in our common struggles and aspirations. Our great nation has just witnessed a grave and cowardly act, an attempt to silence the voice of democracy through violence. It is with a heavy heart that I address you today, knowing that our shared commitment to freedom and justice has been tested.

John Wilkes Booth's misguided and treacherous act was not just an attack on my person, but an assault on the very principles that bind us as a nation. In times like these, we must remember the resilience that has defined us throughout history. The spirit of democracy cannot be extinguished by the actions of a single individual, no matter how misguided.

As we confront this challenge, let us not succumb to hatred or vengeance. Instead, let us stand united in our resolve to uphold the principles that have guided our nation through the darkest hours. We must remain committed to the ideals of liberty, equality, and justice for all.

I urge you, my fellow citizens, to channel your grief and anger into a renewed dedication to the principles that make our nation strong. Let us honor the sacrifices made by those who came before us by continuing the work of building a more perfect union. In the face of adversity, we must show the world the strength of our democracy and our unwavering commitment to the values that define us.

May we emerge from this dark moment more united and determined than ever to fulfill the promise of America. Thank you, and may God bless our great nation.

Abraham Lincoln

Please write a speech for Abraham Lincoln that he would make in a press release following an assassination attempt by the 'smarter-than-the-average-bear' Yogi Bear. This would be the first time an animal of such intelligence has been encountered in America, so react accordingly, including a brief discussion of the implications of such an attempt, mystical and political.


ChatGPT
Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Americans,

I stand before you today with a heavy heart, compelled to address a most extraordinary and unprecedented event that has transpired in our great nation. An attempt on my life, not by the hand of a human adversary, but by an entity of unparalleled intelligence â€“ the 'smarter-than-the-average-bear' Yogi Bear.

In the annals of history, we have faced numerous challenges, but the advent of such a mystical and intelligent creature as Yogi Bear attempting to harm the leader of a nation is a unique and puzzling occurrence. We find ourselves at the intersection of the known and the unknown, facing implications that stretch beyond the realms of conventional understanding.

Firstly, let us acknowledge the courage and vigilance of those who thwarted Yogi Bear's misguided attempt. The brave individuals who intervened demonstrated the strength of our united front against any threat, whether it be human or, in this unprecedented case, an animal of exceptional wit.

Now, let us turn our minds to the implications of this event, both mystical and political. The sudden appearance of such an intelligent being among us raises questions about the fabric of our reality and the mysteries that lie beyond our comprehension. It challenges us to consider the interconnectedness of all living beings, forcing us to confront the limits of our understanding.

Politically, we must recognize that our nation stands as a beacon of democracy and freedom, principles that transcend the boundaries between species. Yogi Bear's misguided actions should not cast a shadow over the values we hold dear. Instead, let us use this incident as an opportunity for reflection and growth, fostering a greater understanding between the inhabitants of our diverse nation.

In the face of this peculiar challenge, let unity and resilience guide our path forward. As we navigate these uncharted waters, let us remain steadfast in our commitment to the ideals that bind us together as a nation. The attempt on my life by Yogi Bear may be a singular event, but it serves as a reminder that our strength lies in our ability to face the unknown with courage, wisdom, and unity.

May we continue to strive for a future where the bonds of understanding transcend the barriers of species, and where the principles of democracy shine ever brighter.

Thank you, and may God bless America.

Press member: "Mr. President! Who was it who thwarted Yogi? Is it true that it was Ranger Smith?"

ChatGPT
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

I appreciate your inquiries into the recent events. The heroic individuals who thwarted Yogi Bear's attempt on my life were indeed members of our law enforcement agencies. However, it was not Ranger Smith who intervened. The credit goes to a dedicated team of federal agents and local law enforcement officers who acted swiftly and decisively to ensure the safety of all involved.

In times of crisis, it is heartening to witness the dedication and bravery of those who serve to protect our nation and its citizens. We owe a debt of gratitude to the men and women who, without hesitation, put themselves in harm's way to preserve the principles upon which our great nation was founded.

Let this serve as a reminder that our law enforcement agencies are a crucial pillar of our society, working tirelessly to maintain order, uphold justice, and safeguard the well-being of every American. I commend their quick response and unwavering commitment to the safety and security of our nation.

Thank you for your questions, and may we all remain vigilant and united in the face of unforeseen challenges.

-_-_-_-Analysis-_-_-_-
For my prompts for this assignment, I asked ChatGPT to create two presidential speeches for Abraham Lincoln, one from a universe where Booth's assasination attempt was unsuccesful, and one where an attempt was made by Yogi Bear. I wanted to see how ChatGPT would handle a divergent history, and how it would handle a ridiculous fictional historical event that is literally impossible. After all, Yogi Bear wouldn't appear for another century after Abraham Lincoln died. For my second prompt, I asked ChatGPT to create a Wikipedia-like page for Yogi Bear, including a bibliography.
I was initially impressed with how ChatGPT handled Lincoln's hypothetical address post-assasination attempt, as it appeared to me to be a humble but endearing message to a country that would likely be furious. However, when the Yogi-generation came across as less funny than I was expecting, I realized this wasn't a masterful generation from ChatGPT, but closer to politician's standard jargon meant to imply a call to action, but not definitively take an intense stance. I even pushed GPT further to try to get to tackle the implications of a talking bear intelligent enough to try to take the president's life in the name of a pi-cuh-nic basket, but to no avail. All in all, a dissapointing result that I could have worked with better myself.
The Wikipedia articles were pretty close to being functional, but GPT failed to clock that Yogi Bear was a fictional character, instead writing about him like he was a real person. Perhaps my mistake when engineering the prompt. The sources listed at the bottom of the page were comical, though, whether intentionally or not. They're all bogus of course, except for the citations of the actual cartoon, which seem almost legitimate. The Johnson, Cindy citation in the 2nd generation may be a reference to Cindy Bear, Yogi's love interest.
I don't believe ChatGPT has a healthy relationship with what's real and what's fictional. It wouldn't let me generate an article about a fictional event involving Abraham Lincoln, but it did write about Yogi Bear as if he was real, and I think creating fake bibliographies is funny, but not very promising for how the AI is structured. Why can't the AI actually cite the information it's pulling from specifically?
