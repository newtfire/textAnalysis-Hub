Response 1: 
Here are simple instructions for crocheting a stuffed duck:

Materials Needed:

Worsted weight yarn in yellow, white, orange, black (I used Lion Brand Vanna's Choice)
Crochet hook size H/5.00mm
Poly-fil stuffing
Yarn needle
Instructions:

Body: With yellow yarn, crochet 6sc into a magic ring. Increase around by crocheting 2 sc in each stitch (12 sc). Continue increasing in this way, working one additional increase round for 18 sc, 24 sc and 30 sc.
Work even without increasing for 10-12 rows.
Decrease around every few rows until you reach 6sc again.
Fasten off, weave in ends. Stuff firmly with poly-fil.
Beak: With orange yarn, crochet 4 sc into a magic ring. Fasten off leaving a long tail, stuff beak lightly and sew to front of duck's head using yarn tail.
Head/Eyes: With white yarn, crochet 2 rounds of 5 sc for eyes, fasten off leaving a yarn tail. Sew eyes centered above beak with yarn tail.
With black yarn, embroider or sew a french knot in center of each white eye.
Optional: Add wings and tail feathers by crocheting small oval shapes in yellow yarn and sewing to body.
Enjoy your new stuffed duck! Let me know if any part needs clarification.
