    <h2>
      <a name="Chapter_I" id="Chapter_I"></a>Chapter I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
      bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
      book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
      it, and where is the use of a book, thought Alice, without pictures or
      conversations? So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she
      could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the
      pleasure of making a daisy-chain was worth the trouble of getting up and
      picking the daisies, when a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so very
      much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself "dear, dear! I shall
      be too late!" (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her
      that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed
      quite natural); but when the rabbit actually <span class="u">took a watch
      out of its waistcoat-pocket</span>, looked at it, and then hurried on,
      Alice started to her feet, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> it flashed across her mind that she had never
      before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out
      of it, and, full of curiosity, she hurried across the field after it, and
      was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
      In a moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the
      world she was to get out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
      dipped suddenly down, so suddenly, that Alice had not a moment to think
      about stopping herself, before she found herself falling down what seemed
      a deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for
      she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder
      what would happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
      she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then, she looked
      at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards
      and book-shelves: here and there were maps and pictures hung on pegs. She
      took a jar down off one of the shelves as she passed: it was labelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> "Orange
      Marmalade," but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like
      to drop the jar, for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to
      put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" thought Alice to herself, "after such a fall as this, I shall
      think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
      home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of
      the house!" (which was most likely true.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Down, down, down. Would the fall <span class="u">never</span> come to an
      end? "I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud,
      "I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see:
      that would be four thousand miles down, I think—" (for you see Alice
      had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom,
      and though this was not a <span class="u">very</span> good opportunity of
      showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to hear her, still it was
      good practice to say it over,) "yes that's the right distance, but then
      what Longitude or Latitude-line shall I be in?" (Alice had no idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> what Longitude
      was, or Latitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to
      say.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she began again: "I wonder if I shall fall right <span class="u">through</span>
      the earth! How funny it'll be to come out among the people that walk with
      their heads downwards! But I shall have to ask them what the name of the
      country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?"—and
      she tried to curtsey as she spoke (fancy <span class="u">curtseying</span>
      as you're falling through the air! do you think you could manage it?) "and
      what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never
      do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Down, down, down: there was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
      talking again. "Dinah will miss me very much tonight, I should think!"
      (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
      tea-time! Oh, dear Dinah, I wish I had you here! There are no mice in the
      air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse,
      you know, my dear. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?" And here Alice began
      to get rather sleepy, and kept on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
      way "do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats?" and sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> "do bats eat
      cats?" for, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter
      which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun
      to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to
      her very earnestly, "Now, Dinah, my dear, tell me the truth. Did you ever
      eat a bat?" when suddenly, bump! bump! down she came upon a heap of sticks
      and shavings, and the fall was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she looked
      up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and
      the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a
      moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and just heard it say,
      as it turned a corner, "my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!" She
      turned the corner after it, and instantly found herself in a long, low
      hall, lit up by a row of lamps which hung from the roof.
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_006.jpg" width="300" height="337" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when
      Alice had been all round it, and tried them all, she walked sadly down the
      middle, wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
      how she was ever to get out again: suddenly she came upon a little
      three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing lying upon
      it, but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that it might belong
      to one of the doors of the hall, but alas! either the locks were too
      large, or the key too small, but at any rate it would open none of them.
      However, on the second time round, she came to a low curtain, behind which
      was a door about eighteen inches high: she tried the little key in the
      keyhole, and it fitted! Alice opened the door, and looked down a small
      passage, not larger than a rat-hole, into the loveliest garden you ever
      saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among
      those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not
      even get her head through the doorway, "and even if my head would go
      through," thought poor Alice, "it would be very little use <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>without my
      shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I
      could, if I only knew how to begin." For, you see, so many out-of-the-way
      things had happened lately, that Alice began to think very few things
      indeed were really impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing else to do, so she went back to the table, half hoping
      she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for
      shutting up people like telescopes: this time there was a little bottle on
      it—"which certainly was not there before" said Alice—and tied
      round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words <b>DRINK ME</b>
      beautifully printed on it in large letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very well to say "drink me," "but I'll look first," said the
      wise little Alice, "and see whether the bottle's marked "poison" or not,"
      for Alice had read several nice little stories about children that got
      burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, because
      they <span class="u">would</span> not remember the simple rules their
      friends had given them, such as, that, if you get into the fire, it will
      burn you, and that, if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it

      she had never forgotten that, if you drink a bottle marked "poison," it is
      almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this bottle was <span class="u">not</span> marked poison, so
      Alice tasted it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of
      mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy,
      and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 45%;">
    <p>
      "What a curious feeling!" said Alice, "I must be shutting up like a
      telescope."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
      brightened up as it occurred to her that she was now the right size for
      going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
      waited for a few minutes to see whether she was going to shrink any
      further: she felt a little nervous about this, "for it might end, you
      know," said Alice to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a candle,
      and what should I be like then, I wonder?" and she tried to fancy what the
      flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> for she could
      not remember having ever seen one. However, nothing more happened so she
      decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor Alice! when
      she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key,
      and when she went back to the table for the key, she found she could not
      possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through the glass, and
      she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was
      too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor
      little thing sat down and cried.
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

    </div>
    <p>
      "Come! there's no use in crying!" said Alice to herself rather sharply, "I
      advise you to leave off this minute!" (she generally gave herself very
      good advice, and sometimes scolded herself so severely as to bring tears
      into her eyes, and once she remembered boxing her own ears for having been
      unkind to herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
      in a game of croquet she was playing with herself, for this curious child
      was very fond of pretending to be two people,) "but it's no use now,"
      thought poor Alice, "to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly
      enough of me left to make one respectable person!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon her eyes fell on a little ebony box lying under the table: she opened
      it, and found in it a very small cake, on which was lying a card with the
      words <b>EAT ME</b> beautifully printed on it in large letters. "I'll
      eat," said Alice, "and if it makes me larger, I can reach the key, and if
      it makes me smaller, I can creep under the door, so either way I'll get
      into the garden, and I don't care which happens!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself "which way? which
      way?" and laid her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
      growing, and was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size:
      to be sure this is what generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
      had got into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the way things to
      happen, and it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
      quite dull and stupid for things to go on in the common way.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 45%;">
    <p>
      "Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice, (she was so surprised that she
      quite forgot how to speak good English,) "now I'm opening out like the
      largest telescope that ever was! Goodbye, feet!" (for when she looked down
      at her feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they were getting so far
      off,) "oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and
      stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I can't! I shall be a great deal
      too far off to bother myself about you: you must manage the best way you
      can—but I must be kind to them," thought Alice, "or perhaps they
      won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of
      boots every Christmas."
    </p>

    <p>
      And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> "they must
      go by the carrier," she thought, "and how funny it'll seem, sending
      presents to one's own feet! <br> And how odd the directions will look! <b>ALICE'S

    <p>
      oh dear! what nonsense I am talking!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment, her head struck against the roof of the hall: in
      fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up
      the little golden key, and hurried off to the garden door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Alice! it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
      look through into the garden with one eye, but to get through was more
      hopeless than ever: she sat down and cried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Alice, "a great girl like
      you," (she might well say this,) "to cry in this way! Stop this instant, I
      tell you!" But she cried on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until
      there was a large pool, about four inches deep, all round her, and
      reaching half way across the hall. After a time, she heard a little
      pattering of feet in the distance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> dried her eyes to see what was
      coming. It was the white rabbit coming back again, splendidly dressed,
      with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand, and a nosegay in the other.
      Alice was ready to ask help of any one, she felt so desperate, and as the
      rabbit passed her, she said, in a low, timid voice, "If you please, Sir—"
      the rabbit started violently, looked up once into the roof of the hall,
      from which the voice seemed to come, and then dropped the nosegay and the
      white kid gloves, and skurried away into the darkness, as hard as it could
      go.
    </p>
    <div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_013.jpg" width="300" height="280" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      Alice took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so delicious
      that she kept smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself—"dear,
      dear! how queer everything is today! and yesterday everything happened
      just as usual: I wonder if I was changed in the night? Let me think: was I
      the same when I got up this morning? I think I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> feeling
      rather different. But if I'm not the same, who in the world am I? Ah,
      that's the great puzzle!" And she began thinking over all the children she
      knew of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for
      any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I'm not Gertrude," she said, "for her hair goes in such long
      ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all—and I'm sure I
      ca'n't be Florence, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows
      such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and—oh dear! how
      puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let
      me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and
      four times seven is fourteen—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at
      this rate! But the Multiplication Table don't signify—let's try
      Geography. London is the capital of France, and Rome is the capital of
      Yorkshire, and Paris—oh dear! dear! <span class="u">that's</span>
      all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for Florence! I'll try
      and say "How doth the little,"" and she crossed her hands on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> lap, and
      began, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not
      sound the same as they used to do:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i0">"How doth the little crocodile<br></span> <span class="i2">Improve its shining tail,<br></span> <span class="i0">And

        gently-smiling jaws!"<br></span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      "I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor Alice, and her eyes
      filled with tears as she thought "I must be Florence after all, and I
      shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no
      toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No! I've made up
      my mind about it: if I'm Florence, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use
      their putting their heads down and saying 'come <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>up, dear!' I shall only look up
      and say 'who am I then? answer me that first, and then, if I like being
      that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody
      else—but, oh dear!" cried Alice with a sudden burst of tears, "I do
      wish they <span class="u">would</span> put their heads down! I am so tired
      of being all alone here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she said this, she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to find
      she had put on one of the rabbit's little gloves while she was talking.
      "How <span class="u">can</span> I have done that?" thought she, "I must be
      growing small again." She got up and went to the table to measure herself
      by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two
      feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: soon she found out that the
      reason of it was the nosegay she held in her hand: she dropped it hastily,
      just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether, and found
      that she was now only three inches high.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now for the garden!" cried Alice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> as she hurried back to the little door, but
      the little door was locked again, and the little gold key was lying on the
      glass table as before, and "things are worse than ever!" thought the poor
      little girl, "for I never was as small as this before, never! And I
      declare it's too bad, it is!"
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_017.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      At this moment her foot slipped, and splash! she was up to her chin in
      salt water. Her first idea was that she had fallen into the sea: then she
      remembered that she was under ground, and she soon made out that it was
      the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high. "I wish I
      hadn't cried so much!" said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her
      way out, "I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in
      my own tears! Well! that'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> be a queer thing, to be sure! However, every
      thing is queer today." Very soon she saw something splashing about in the
      pool near her: at first she thought it must be a walrus or a hippopotamus,
      but then she remembered how small she was herself, and soon made out that
      it was only a mouse, that had slipped in like herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it be any use, now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse? The
      rabbit is something quite out-of-the-way, no doubt, and so have I been,
      ever since I came down here, but that is no reason why the mouse should
      not be able to talk. I think I may as well try."
    </p>
    <p>
      So she began: "oh Mouse, do you know how to get out of this pool? I am
      very tired of swimming about here, oh Mouse!" The mouse looked at her
      rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
      eyes, but it said nothing.
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
      <img class="img1" src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_019.jpg" width="600" height="318" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice; "I daresay it's a
      French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror!" (for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>with all her
      knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything
      had happened,) so she began again: "où est ma chatte?" which was
      the first sentence out of her French lesson-book. The mouse gave a sudden
      jump in the pool, and seemed to quiver with fright: "oh, I beg your
      pardon!" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's
      feelings, "I quite forgot you didn't like cats!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not like cats!" cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice, "would
      <span class="u">you</span> like cats if you were me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone, "don't be angry about
      it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a
      fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,"
      said Alice, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, "she
      sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face:
      and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse, and she's such a capital one
      for catching mice—oh! I beg your pardon!" cried poor Alice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> again, for
      this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain that it
      was really offended, "have I offended you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Offended indeed!" cried the mouse, who seemed to be positively trembling
      with rage, "our family always <span class="u">hated</span> cats! Nasty,
      low, vulgar things! Don't talk to me about them any more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't indeed!" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the conversation,
      "are you—are you—fond of—dogs?" The mouse did not
      answer, so Alice went on eagerly: "there is such a nice little dog near
      our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
      know, with oh! such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you
      throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of
      things—I ca'n't remember half of them—and it belongs to a
      farmer, and he says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!" said Alice
      sadly, "I'm afraid I've offended it again!" for the mouse was swimming
      away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
      pool as it went.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      So she called softly after it: "mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
      won't talk about cats and dogs any more, if you don't like them!" When the
      mouse heard this, it turned and swam slowly back to her: its face was
      quite pale, (with passion, Alice thought,) and it said in a trembling low
      voice "let's get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and
      you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of birds and
      animals that had fallen into it. There was a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and
      an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the
      whole party swam to the shore.

      They were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the bank—the
      birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to
      them—all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. The first question
      of course was, how to get dry: they had a consultation about this, and
      Alice hardly felt at all surprised at finding herself talking familiarly
      with the birds, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had
      quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would
      only say "I am older than you, and must know best," and this Alice would
      not admit without knowing how old the Lory was, and as the Lory positively
      refused to tell its age, there was nothing more to be said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the mouse, who seemed to have some authority among them, called
      out "sit down, all of you, and attend to me! I'll soon make you dry
      enough!" They all sat down at once, shivering, in a large ring, Alice in
      the middle, with her eyes anxiously fixed on the mouse, for she felt sure
      she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahem!" said the mouse, with a self-important air, "are you all ready?
      This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!
    </p>
    <p>
      "William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon
      submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
      accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
      Mercia and Northumbria—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugh!" said the Lory with a shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon?" said the mouse, frowning, but very politely, "did you
      speak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I!" said the Lory hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you did," said the mouse, "I proceed. Edwin and Morcar, the
      earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> and even Stigand, the
      patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable to go with Edgar
      Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William's conduct was at
      first moderate—how are you getting on now, dear?" said the mouse,
      turning to Alice as it spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As wet as ever," said poor Alice, "it doesn't seem to dry me at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to his feet, "I move that
      the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak English!" said the Duck, "I don't know the meaning of half those
      long words, and what's more, I don't believe you do either!" And the Duck
      quacked a comfortable laugh to itself. Some of the other birds tittered
      audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only meant to say," said the Dodo in a rather offended tone, "that I
      know of a house near here, where we could get the young lady and the rest
      of the party dried, and then we could listen comfortably to the story
      which I think you were good enough to promise to tell us," bowing gravely
      to the mouse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The mouse made no objection to this, and the whole party moved along the
      river bank, (for the pool had by this time began to flow out of the hall,
      and the edge of it was fringed with rushes and forget-me-nots,) in a slow
      procession, the Dodo leading the way. After a time the Dodo became
      impatient, and, leaving the Duck to bring up the rest of the party, moved
      on at a quicker pace with Alice, the Lory, and the Eaglet, and soon
      brought them to a little cottage, and there they sat snugly by the fire,
      wrapped up in blankets, until the rest of the party had arrived, and they
      were all dry again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank, and begged the
      mouse to begin his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine is a long and a sad tale!" said the mouse, turning to Alice, and
      sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It <span class="u">is</span> a long tail, certainly," said Alice, looking
      down with wonder at the mouse's tail, which was coiled nearly all round
      the party, "but why do you call it sad?" and she went on puzzling about
      this as the mouse went on speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
      something like this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>

      "You are not attending!" said the mouse to Alice severely, "what are you
      thinking of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon," said Alice very humbly, "you had got to the fifth
      bend, I think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had not!" cried the mouse, sharply and very angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A knot!" said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
      anxiously about her, "oh, do let me help to undo it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall do nothing of the sort!" said the mouse, getting up and walking
      away from the party, "you insult me by talking such nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't mean it!" pleaded poor Alice, "but you're so easily offended,
      you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mouse only growled in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please come back and finish your story!" Alice called after it, and the
      others all joined in chorus "yes, please do!" but the mouse only shook its
      ears, and walked quickly away, and was soon out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sighed the Lory, and an old Crab took the
      opportunity of saying to its daughter "Ah, my dear!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> let this be a lesson to you
      never to lose <span class="u">your</span> temper!" "Hold your tongue, Ma!"
      said the young Crab, a little snappishly, "you're enough to try the
      patience of an oyster!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!" said Alice aloud, addressing
      no one in particular, "she'd soon fetch it back!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?" said the Lory.
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

    </div>
    <p>
      Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet,
      "Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice, you
      can't think! And oh! I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she'll
      eat a little bird as soon as look at it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party: some of the
      birds hurried off at once; one old magpie began wrapping itself up very
      carefully, remarking "I really must be getting home: the night air does
      not suit my throat," and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its
      children "come away from her, my dears, she's no fit company for you!" On
      various pretexts, they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat for some while sorrowful and silent, but she was not long before
      she recovered her spirits, and began talking to herself again as usual: "I
      do wish some of them had stayed a little longer! and I was getting to be
      such friends with them—really the Lory and I were almost like
      sisters! and so was that dear little Eaglet! And then the Duck and the
      Dodo! How nicely the Duck sang to us as we came along through the water:
      and if the Dodo hadn't known the way to that nice little cottage, I don't
      know when we should have got dry again—" and there is no knowing how
      long she might have prattled on in this way, if she had not suddenly
      caught the sound of pattering feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously
      about it as it went, as if it had lost something, and she heard it
      muttering to itself "the Marchioness! the Marchioness! oh my dear paws! oh
      my fur and whiskers! She'll have me executed, as sure as ferrets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> are
      ferrets! Where <span class="u">can</span> I have dropped them, I wonder?"
      Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the nosegay and the pair
      of white kid gloves, and she began hunting for them, but they were now
      nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim
      in the pool, and her walk along the river-bank with its fringe of rushes
      and forget-me-nots, and the glass table and the little door had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the rabbit noticed Alice, as she stood looking curiously about her,
      and at once said in a quick angry tone, "why, Mary Ann! what <span class="u">are</span> you doing out here? Go home this moment, and look on
      my dressing-table for my gloves and nosegay, and fetch them here, as quick
      as you can run, do you hear?" and Alice was so much frightened that she
      ran off at once, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> saying a word, in the direction which the
      rabbit had pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon found herself in front of a neat little house, on the door of
      which was a bright brass plate with the name <b>W. RABBIT, ESQ.</b> She
      went in, and hurried upstairs, for fear she should meet the real Mary Ann
      and be turned out of the house before she had found the gloves: she knew
      that one pair had been lost in the hall, "but of course," thought Alice,
      "it has plenty more of them in its house. How queer it seems to be going
      messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me messages next!"
      And she began fancying the sort of things that would happen: "Miss Alice!
      come here directly and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a minute,
      nurse! but I've got to watch this mousehole till Dinah comes back, and see
      that the mouse doesn't get out—" "only I don't think," Alice went
      on, "that they'd let Dinah stop in the house, if it began ordering people
      about like that!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_035.jpg" width="300" height="306" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room, with a table
      in the window on which was a looking-glass and, (as Alice had hoped,) two
      or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up a pair of gloves, and
      was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle
      that stood near the looking-glass: there was no label on it this time with
      the words "drink me," but nonetheless she uncorked it and put it to her
      lips: "I know something interesting is sure to happen," she said to
      herself, "whenever I eat or drink anything, so I'll see what this bottle
      does. I do hope it'll make me grow larger, for I'm quite tired of being
      such a tiny little thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It did so indeed, and much sooner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> than she expected: before she had drunk half
      the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and she
      stooped to save her neck from being broken, and hastily put down the
      bottle, saying to herself "that's quite enough—I hope I sha'n't grow
      any more—I wish I hadn't drunk so much!"
    </p>
    <div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_036.jpg" width="300" height="317" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      Alas! it was too late: she went on growing and growing, and very soon had
      to kneel down: in another minute there was not room even for this, and she
      tried the effect of lying down, with one elbow against the door, and the
      other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and as a last
      resource she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney,
      and said to herself "now I can do no more—what <span class="u">will</span>
      become of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
      and she grew no larger; still it was very uncomfortable, and as there
      seemed to be no sort of chance of ever getting out of the room again, no
      wonder she felt unhappy. "It was much pleasanter at home," thought poor
      Alice, "when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being
      ordered about by mice and rabbits—I almost wish I hadn't gone down
      that rabbit-hole, and yet, and yet—it's rather curious, you know,
      this sort of life. I do wonder what <span class="u">can</span> have
      happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that sort of
      thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There out to
      be a book written about me, that there ought! and when I grow up I'll
      write one—but I'm grown up now" said she in a sorrowful tone, "at
      least there's no room to grow up any more <span class="u">here</span>."
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_037.jpg" alt="Illustration" width="600" height="322" class="img1">
    </div>
    <p>
      "But then," thought Alice, "shall I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span><span class="u">never</span> get any older
      than I am now? That'll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old
      woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I
      shouldn't like <span class="u">that</span>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you foolish Alice!" she said again, "how can you learn lessons in
      here? Why, there's hardly room for you, and no room at all for any
      lesson-books!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she went on, taking first one side, and then the other, and making
      quite a conversation of it altogether, but after a few minutes she heard a
      voice outside, which made her stop to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary Ann! Mary Ann!" said the voice, "fetch me my gloves this moment!"
      Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs: Alice knew it was the
      rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house,
      quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the
      rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it. Presently the rabbit came to
      the door, and tried to open it, but as it opened inwards, and Alice's
      elbow was against it, the attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> say to
      itself "then I'll go round and get in at the window."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<span class="u">That</span> you wo'n't!" thought Alice, and, after
      waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit, just under the window, she
      suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not
      get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash
      of breaking glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it
      had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_040.jpg" width="300" height="319" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      Next came an angry voice—the rabbit's—"Pat, Pat! where are
      you?" And then a voice she had never heard before, "shure then I'm here!
      digging for apples, anyway, yer honour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Digging for apples indeed!" said the rabbit angrily, "here, come and help
      me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> out
      of <span class="u">this</span>!"—Sound of more breaking glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, tell me, Pat, what is that coming out of the window?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shure it's an arm, yer honour!" (He pronounced it "arrum".)
    </p>
    <p>
      "An arm, you goose! Who ever saw an arm that size? Why, it fills the whole
      window, don't you see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shure, it does, yer honour, but it's an arm for all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's no business there: go and take it away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
      now and then, such as "shure I don't like it, yer honour, at all at all!"
      "do as I tell you, you coward!" and at last she spread out her hand again
      and made another snatch in the air. This time there were <span class="u">two</span>
      little shrieks, and more breaking glass—"what a number of
      cucumber-frames there must be!" thought Alice, "I wonder what they'll do
      next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they <span class="u">could</span>!
      I'm sure <span class="u">I</span> don't want to stop in here any longer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited for some time without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> hearing anything more: at last came a
      rumbling of little cart-wheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
      talking together: she made out the words "where's the other ladder?—why,
      I hadn't to bring but one, Bill's got the other—here, put 'em up at
      this corner—no, tie 'em together first—they don't reach high
      enough yet—oh, they'll do well enough, don't be particular—here,
      Bill! catch hold of this rope—will the roof bear?—mind that
      loose slate—oh, it's coming down! heads below!—" (a loud
      crash) "now, who did that?—it was Bill, I fancy—who's to go
      down the chimney?—nay, <span class="u">I</span> sha'n't! <span class="u">you</span> do it!—<span class="u">that</span> I won't then—Bill's
      got to go down—here, Bill! the master says you've to go down the
      chimney!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, so Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?" said Alice to
      herself, "why, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
      Bill's place for a good deal: the fireplace is a pretty tight one, but I
      <span class="u">think</span> I can kick a little!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
      she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
      heard a little animal (she couldn't guess what sort it was) scratching and
      scrambling in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself "this
      is Bill," she gave one sharp kick, and waited again to see what would
      happen next.
    </p>
    <div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_043.jpg" width="300" height="325" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      The first thing was a general chorus of "there goes Bill!" then the
      rabbit's voice alone "catch him, you by the hedge!" then silence, and then
      another confusion of voices, "how was it, old fellow? what happened to
      you? tell us all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Last came a little feeble squeaking voice, ("that's Bill" thought Alice,)
      which said "well, I hardly know—I'm all of a fluster myself—something
      comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and the next minute up I goes like a
      rocket!" "And so you did, old fellow!" said the other voices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must burn the house down!" said the voice of the rabbit, and Alice
      called out as loud as she could "if you do, I'll set Dinah at you!" This
      caused silence again, and while Alice was thinking "but how can I get
      Dinah here?" she found to her great delight that she was getting smaller:
      very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable position in
      which she had been lying, and in two or three minutes more she was once
      more three inches high.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran out of the house as quick as she could, and found quite a crowd of
      little animals waiting outside—guinea-pigs, white mice, squirrels,
      and "Bill" a little green lizard, that was being supported in the arms of
      one of the guinea-pigs, while another was giving it something out of a
      bottle. They all made a rush at her the moment she appeared, but Alice ran
      her hardest, and soon found herself in a thick wood.

      "The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself, as she wandered
      about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size, and the second thing is
      to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best
      plan."
    </p>
    <p>
      It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
      arranged: the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how
      to set about it, and while she was peering anxiously among the trees round
      her, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great
      hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
      feebly stretching out one paw, trying to reach her: "poor thing!" said
      Alice in a coaxing tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> and she tried hard to whistle to it, but she
      was terribly alarmed all the while at the thought that it might be hungry,
      in which case it would probably devour her in spite of all her coaxing.
      Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held
      it out to the puppy: whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its
      feet at once, and with a yelp of delight rushed at the stick, and made
      believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep
      herself from being run over, and, the moment she appeared at the other
      side, the puppy made another dart at the stick, and tumbled head over
      heels in its hurry to get hold: then Alice, thinking it was very like
      having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be
      trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again: then the puppy begin
      a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards
      each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at
      last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of
      its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape. She set off
      at once, and ran till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the
      distance, and till she was quite tired and out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet what a dear little puppy it was!" said Alice, as she leant
      against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with her hat. "I
      should have liked teaching it tricks, if—if I'd only been the right
      size to do it! Oh! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!
      Let me see; how <i>is</i> it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or
      drink something or other, but the great question is what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the
      flowers and the blades of grass but could not see anything that looked
      like the right thing to eat under the circumstances. There was a large
      mushroom near her, about the same height as herself, and when she had
      looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to
      her to look and see what was on the top of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
      mushroom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
      and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, which was
      sitting with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking
      not the least notice of her or of anything else.
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_049.jpg" width="300" height="356" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      For some time they looked at each other in silence: at last the
      caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and languidly addressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you?" said the caterpillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation: Alice replied
      rather shyly, "I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least
      I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
      changed several times since that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that?" said the caterpillar, "explain yourself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ca'n't explain <span class="u">myself</span>, I'm afraid, sir,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> said Alice,
      "because I'm not myself, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see," said the caterpillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," Alice replied very politely,
      "for I ca'n't understand it myself, and really to be so many different
      sizes in one day is very confusing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't," said the caterpillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said Alice, "but when you
      have to turn into a chrysalis, you know, and then after that into a
      butterfly, I should think it'll feel a little queer, don't you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit," said the caterpillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I know is," said Alice, "it would feel queer to <span class="u">me</span>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<span class="u">You</span>!" said the caterpillar contemptuously, "who
      are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation: Alice
      felt a little irritated at the caterpillar making such very short remarks,
      and she drew herself up and said very gravely "I think you ought to tell
      me who <span class="u">you</span> are, first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" said the caterpillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was another puzzling question:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> and as Alice had no reason ready, and the
      caterpillar seemed to be in a very bad temper, she turned round and walked
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back!" the caterpillar called after her, "I've something important
      to say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This sounded promising: Alice turned and came back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your temper," said the caterpillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all?" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the caterpillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
      perhaps after all the caterpillar might tell her something worth hearing.
      For some minutes it puffed away at its hookah without speaking, but at
      last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and
      said "so you think you're changed, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said Alice, "I ca'n't remember the things I used to know—I've
      tried to say "How doth the little busy bee" and it came all different!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try and repeat "You are old, father William"," said the caterpillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice folded her hands, and began:

      "That is not said right," said the caterpillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite right, I'm afraid," said Alice timidly, "some of the words have
      got altered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is wrong from beginning to end," said the caterpillar decidedly, and
      there was silence for some minutes: the caterpillar was the first to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What size do you want to be?" it asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily replied, "only one
      doesn't like changing so often, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you content now?" said the caterpillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I should like to be a <span class="u">little</span> larger, sir, if
      you wouldn't mind," said Alice, "three inches is such a wretched height to
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a very good height indeed!" said the caterpillar loudly and
      angrily, rearing itself straight up as it spoke (it was exactly three
      inches high).
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'm not used to it!" pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone, and she
      thought to herself "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll get used to it in time," said the caterpillar, and it put the
      hookah into its mouth, and began smoking again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Alice waited quietly until it chose to speak again: in a few
      minutes the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and got down off
      the mushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking as it
      went; "the top will make you grow taller, and the stalk will make you grow
      shorter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The top of <span class="u">what</span>? the stalk of <span class="u">what</span>?"
      thought Alice.
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_061.jpg" width="300" height="301" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      "Of the mushroom," said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
      aloud, and in another moment was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, and then
      picked it and carefully broke it in two, taking the stalk in one hand, and
      the top in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<span class="u">Which</span> does the stalk do?" she said, and nibbled a
      little bit of it to try; the next moment she felt a violent blow on her
      chin: it had struck her foot!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but as she did
      not shrink any further, and had not dropped the top of the mushroom, she
      did not give up hope yet. There was hardly room to open her mouth, with
      her chin pressing against her foot, but she did it at last, and managed to
      bite off a little bit of the top of the mushroom.
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 45%;">
    <p>
      "Come! my head's free at last!" said Alice in a tone of delight, which
      changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
      were nowhere to be seen: she looked down upon an immense length of neck,
      which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
      far below her.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What <span class="u">can</span> all that green stuff be?" said Alice,
      "and where <span class="u">have</span> my shoulders got to? And oh! my
      poor hands! how is it I ca'n't see you?" She was moving them about as she
      spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little rustling among the
      leaves. Then she tried to bring her head down to her hands, and was
      delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in every
      direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in bending it down in a
      beautiful zig-zag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she
      found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had been wandering in,
      when a sharp hiss made her draw back: a large pigeon had flown into her
      face, and was violently beating her with its wings.
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_063.jpg" width="300" height="303" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      "Serpent!" screamed the pigeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm <span class="u">not</span> a serpent!" said Alice indignantly, "let
      me alone!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've tried every way!" the pigeon said desperately, with a kind of sob:
      "nothing seems to suit 'em!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't the least idea what you mean," said Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
      hedges," the pigeon went on without attending to her, "but them serpents!
      There's no pleasing 'em!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
      saying anything till the pigeon had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs!" said the pigeon,
      "without being on the look out for serpents, day and night! Why, I haven't
      had a wink of sleep these three weeks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm very sorry you've been annoyed," said Alice, beginning to see its
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," said the pigeon
      raising its voice to a shriek, "and was just thinking I was free of 'em at
      last, they must needs come down from the sky! Ugh! Serpent!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'm <span class="u">not</span> a serpent," said Alice, "I'm a—I'm
      a—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! <span class="u">What</span> are you?" said the pigeon, "I see
      you're trying to invent something."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "I—I'm a little girl," said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she
      remembered the number of changes she had gone through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A likely story indeed!" said the pigeon, "I've seen a good many of them
      in my time, but never <span class="u">one</span> with such a neck as
      yours! No, you're a serpent, I know <span class="u">that</span> well
      enough! I suppose you'll tell me next that you never tasted an egg!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <span class="u">have</span> tasted eggs, certainly," said Alice, who
      was a very truthful child, "but indeed I do'n't want any of yours. I
      do'n't like them raw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, be off, then!" said the pigeon, and settled down into its nest
      again. Alice crouched down among the trees, as well as she could, as her
      neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and several times she had
      to stop and untwist it. Soon she remembered the pieces of mushroom which
      she still held in her hands, and set to work very carefully, nibbling
      first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and
      sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her
      usual size.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so long since she had been of the right size that it felt quite
      strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
      at first, but she got quite used to it in a minute or two, and began
      talking to herself as usual: "well! there's half my plan done now! How
      puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from
      one minute to another! However, I've got to my right size again: the next
      thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how <span class="u">is</span>
      that to be done, I wonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a doorway
      leading right into it. "That's very curious!" she thought, "but
      everything's curious today: I may as well go in." And in she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
      glass table: "now, I'll manage better this time" she said to herself, and
      began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led
      into the garden. Then she set to work eating the pieces of mushroom till
      she was about fifteen inches high: then she walked down the little
      passage: and <span class="u">then</span>—she found herself at last
      in the beautiful garden, among the bright flowerbeds and the cool
      fountains.

    </h2>
    <p>
      A large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses on it
      were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them
      red. This Alice thought a very curious thing, and she went near to watch
      them, and just as she came up she heard one of them say "look out, Five!
      Don't go splashing paint over me like that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't help it," said Five in a sulky tone, "Seven jogged my elbow."
    </p>
    <p>
      On which Seven lifted up his head and said "that's right, Five! Always lay
      the blame on others!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<span class="u">You'd</span> better not talk!" said Five, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> heard the
      Queen say only yesterday she thought of having you beheaded!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" said the one who had spoken first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not your business, Two!" said Seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it <span class="u">is</span> his business!" said Five, "and I'll
      tell him: it was for bringing in tulip-roots to the cook instead of
      potatoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun "well! Of all the unjust
      things—" when his eye fell upon Alice, and he stopped suddenly; the
      others looked round, and all of them took off their hats and bowed low.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you tell me, please," said Alice timidly, "why you are painting
      those roses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Five and Seven looked at Two, but said nothing: Two began, in a low voice,
      "why, Miss, the fact is, this ought to have been a red rose tree, and we
      put a white one in by mistake, and if the Queen was to find it out, we
      should all have our heads cut off. So, you see, we're doing our best,
      before she comes, to—" At this moment Five, who had been looking
      anxiously across the garden called out "the Queen! the Queen!" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> the three
      gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a
      sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
      three gardeners, flat and oblong, with their hands and feet at the
      corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all ornamented with diamonds,
      and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the Royal
      children: there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping
      merrily along, hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with
      hearts. Next came the guests, mostly kings and queens, among whom Alice
      recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner,
      smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her.
      Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a cushion,
      and, last of all this grand procession, came <b>THE KING AND QUEEN OF
      HEARTS</b>.
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_071.jpg" alt="Illustration" width="600" height="317" class="img1">
    </div>
    <p>
      When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at
      her, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>the
      Queen said severely "who is this?" She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who
      only bowed and smiled in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Idiot!" said the Queen, turning up her nose, and asked Alice "what's your
      name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Alice, so please your Majesty," said Alice boldly, for she
      thought to herself "why, they're only a pack of cards! I needn't be afraid
      of them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are these?" said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners lying
      round the rose tree, for, as they were lying on their faces, and the
      pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not
      tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of
      her own children.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How should <span class="u">I</span> know?" said Alice, surprised at her
      own courage, "it's no business of <span class="u">mine</span>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
      minute, began in a voice of thunder "off with her—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King laid his hand upon her arm, and said timidly "remember, my dear!
      She is only a child!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave "turn them
      over!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up!" said the Queen, in a shrill loud voice, and the three gardeners
      instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the Royal
      children, and everybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave off that!" screamed the Queen, "you make me giddy." And then,
      turning to the rose tree, she went on "what <span class="u">have</span>
      you been doing here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May it please your Majesty," said Two very humbly, going down on one knee
      as he spoke, "we were trying—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see!" said the Queen, who had meantime been examining the roses, "off
      with their heads!" and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers
      remaining behind to execute the three unfortunate gardeners, who ran to
      Alice for protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sha'n't be beheaded!" said Alice, and she put them into her pocket:
      the three soldiers marched once round her, looking for them, and then
      quietly marched off after the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are their heads off?" shouted the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their heads are gone," the soldiers shouted in reply, "if it please your
      Majesty!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right!" shouted the Queen, "can you play croquet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
      evidently meant for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" shouted Alice at the top of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on then!" roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
      wondering very much what would happen next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's—it's a very fine day!" said a timid little voice: she was
      walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very," said Alice, "where's the Marchioness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, hush!" said the rabbit in a low voice, "she'll hear you. The
      Queen's the Marchioness: didn't you know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I didn't," said Alice, "what of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queen of Hearts," said the rabbit in a whisper, putting its mouth close
      to her ear, "and Marchioness of Mock Turtles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are <span class="u">they</span>?" said Alice, but there was no time
      for the answer, for they had reached the croquet-ground, and the game
      began instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in all her
      life: it was all in ridges and furrows: the croquet-balls were live
      hedgehogs, the mallets live ostriches, and the soldiers had to double
      themselves up, and stand <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>on their feet and hands, to make the arches.
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_075.jpg" alt="Illustration" width="600" height="323" class="img1">
    </div>
    <p>
      The chief difficulty which Alice found at first was to manage her ostrich:
      she got its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its
      legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck
      straightened out nicely, and was going to give a blow with its head, it
      <span class="u">would</span> twist itself round, and look up into her
      face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out
      laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin
      again, it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
      itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was
      generally a ridge or a furrow in her way, wherever she wanted to send the
      hedgehog to, and as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and
      walking off to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
      parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very
      difficult game indeed.
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_076.jpg" width="300" height="309" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      The players all played at once without waiting for turns, and quarrelled
      all the while at the tops of their voices, and in a very few minutes the
      Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about and shouting "off
      with his head!" of "off with her head!" about once in a minute. All those
      whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course
      had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of half an
      hour or so, there were no arches left, and all the players, except the
      King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody, and under sentence of
      execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice "have you
      seen the Mock Turtle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Alice, "I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on then," said the Queen, "and it shall tell you its history."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to
      the company generally, "you are all pardoned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, that's a good thing!" thought Alice, who had felt quite grieved at
      the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
      executions which the Queen had ordered.
    </p>
    <div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_078.jpg" width="350" height="183" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      They very soon came upon a Gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the sun: (if
      you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture): "Up, lazy thing!"
      said the Queen, "and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to
      hear its history. I must go back and see after some executions I ordered,"
      and she walked off, leaving Alice with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite
      like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it quite as
      safe to stay as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she
      was out of sight: then it chuckled. "What fun!" said the Gryphon, half to
      itself, half to Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What <span class="u">is</span> the fun?" said Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, <span class="u">she</span>," said the Gryphon; "it's all her fancy,
      that: they never executes nobody, you know: come on!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody says 'come on!' here," thought Alice as she walked slowly after
      the Gryphon; "I never was ordered about so before in all my life—never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
      sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
      nearer, Alice could here it sighing as if its heart would break. She
      pitied it deeply: "what is its sorrow?" she asked the Gryphon, and the
      Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, "it's all its
      fancy, that: it hasn't got no sorrow, you know: come on!"
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_079.jpg" width="300" height="385" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
      full of tears, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This here young lady" said the Gryphon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> "wants for to know your
      history, she do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell it," said the Mock Turtle, in a deep hollow tone, "sit down,
      and don't speak till I've finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they sat down, and no one spoke for some minutes: Alice thought to
      herself "I don't see how it can <span class="u">ever</span> finish, if it
      doesn't begin," but she waited patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once," said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, "I was a real
      Turtle."
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
      occasional exclamation of "hjckrrh!" from the Gryphon, and the constant
      heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
      saying, "thank you, sir, for your interesting story," but she could not
      help thinking there <span class="u">must</span> be more to come, so she
      sat still and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we were little," the Mock Turtle went on, more calmly, though still
      sobbing a little now and then, "we went to school in the sea. The master
      was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?" asked Alice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the Mock Turtle
      angrily, "really you are very dull!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,"
      added the Gryphon, and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice,
      who felt ready to sink into the earth: at last the Gryphon said to the
      Mock Turtle, "get on, old fellow! Don't be all day!" and the Mock Turtle
      went on in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may not have lived much under the sea—" ("I haven't," said
      Alice,) "and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—"
      (Alice began to say "I once tasted—" but hastily checked herself,
      and said "no, never," instead,) "so you can have no idea what a delightful
      thing a Lobster Quadrille is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed," said Alice, "what sort of a thing is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said the Gryphon, "you form into a line along the sea shore—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two lines!" cried the Mock Turtle, "seals, turtles, salmon, and so on—advance
      twice—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Each with a lobster as partner!" cried the Gryphon.
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_082.jpg" alt="Illustration" width="400" height="712" class="img1">
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," the Mock Turtle said, "advance twice, set to partners—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Change lobsters, and retire in same order—" interrupted the
      Gryphon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, you know," continued the Mock Turtle, "you throw the—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lobsters!" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As far out to sea as you can—"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swim after them!" screamed the Gryphon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn a somersault in the sea!" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Change lobsters again!" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice, "and
      then—"
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
      <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_084.jpg" width="300" height="260" alt="Illustration">
    </div>
    <p>
      "That's all," said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping its voice, and the
      two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time,
      sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be a very pretty dance," said Alice timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you like to see a little of it?" said the Mock Turtle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much indeed," said Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, let's try the first figure!" said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon,
      "we can do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
      it without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! <span class="u">you</span> sing!" said the Gryphon, "I've forgotten
      the words."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then
      treading on her toes when they came too close, and waving their fore-paws
      to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang, slowly and sadly, these
      words:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i0">"Beneath the waters of the sea<br></span> <span class="i0">Are lobsters thick as thick can be—<br></span> <span class="i0">They love to dance with you and me,<br></span> <span class="i2">My own, my gentle Salmon!"<br></span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The Gryphon joined in singing the chorus, which was:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i0">"Salmon come up! Salmon go down!<br></span> <span class="i0">Salmon come twist your tail around!<br></span> <span class="i0">Of all the fishes <span class="u">of</span> the sea<br></span>
        <span class="i2">There's none so good as Salmon!"<br></span> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Alice, feeling very glad that the figure was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we try the second figure?" said the Gryphon, "or would you prefer a
      song?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a song, please!" Alice replied, so eagerly, that the Gryphon said, in
      a rather offended tone, "hm! no accounting for tastes! Sing her 'Mock
      Turtle Soup', will you, old fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with
      sobs, to sing this:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i0">"Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,<br></span> <span class="i0">Waiting in a hot tureen!<br></span> <span class="i0">Who for

        <span class="i4">Beautiful beautiful Soup!<br></span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      "Chorus again!" cried the Gryphon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> the Mock Turtle had just begun
      to repeat it, when a cry of "the trial's beginning!" was heard in the
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on!" cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, he hurried
      off, without waiting for the end of the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What trial is it?" panted Alice as she ran, but the Gryphon only answered
      "come on!" and ran the faster, and more and more faintly came, borne on
      the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i0">"Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,<br></span>

    </div>
    <p>
      The King and Queen were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a
      great crowd assembled around them: the Knave was in custody: and before
      the King stood the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll
      of parchment in the other.

      "Herald! read the accusation!" said the King.

      On this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
      unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:

      </div>

    <p>
      "Now for the evidence," said the King, "and then the sentence."
    </p>
    <div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">

    <p>
      "No!" said the Queen, "first the sentence, and then the evidence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" cried Alice, so loudly that everybody jumped, "the idea of
      having the sentence first!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your tongue!" said the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't!" said Alice, "you're nothing but a pack of cards! Who cares for
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
      her: she gave a little scream of fright, and tried to beat them off, and
      found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister,
      who was gently brushing away some leaves that had fluttered down from the
      trees on to her face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wake up! Alice dear!" said her sister, "what a nice long sleep you've
      had!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said Alice, and she told her sister
      all her Adventures Under Ground, as you have read them, and when she had
      finished, her sister kissed her and said "it <span class="u">was</span> a
      curious dream, dear, certainly! But now run in to your tea: it's getting
      late."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Alice ran off, thinking while she ran (as well she might) what a
      wonderful dream it had been.
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 45%;">
    <p>
      But her sister sat there some while longer, watching the setting sun, and
      thinking of little Alice and her Adventures, till she too began dreaming
      after a fashion, and this was her dream:
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw an ancient city, and a quiet river winding near it along the
      plain, and up the stream went slowly gliding a boat with a merry party of
      children on board—she could hear their voices and laughter like
      music over the water—and among them was another little Alice, who
      sat listening with bright eager eyes to a tale that was being told, and
      she listened for the words of the tale, and lo! it was the dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> of her own
      little sister. So the boat wound slowly along, beneath the bright
      summer-day, with its merry crew and its music of voices and laughter, till
      it passed round one of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw it no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how this same
      little Alice would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman: and how
      she would keep, through her riper years, the simple and loving heart of
      her childhood: and how she would gather around her other little children,
      and make <span class="u">their</span> eyes bright and eager with many a
      wonderful tale, perhaps even with these very adventures of the little
      Alice of long-ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows,
      and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own
      child-life, and the happy summer days.

    <h2>
      "Who will Riddle me the How and the Why?"
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>So questions one of England's sweetest singers. The "How?" has already
      been told, after a fashion, in the verses prefixed to "Alice in
      Wonderland"; and some other memories of that happy summer day are set
      down, for those who care to see them, in this little book—the germ
      that was to grow into the published volume. But the "Why?" cannot, and
      need not, be put into words. Those for whom a child's mind is a sealed
      book, and who see no divinity in a child's smile, would read such words in
      vain: while for any one that has ever loved one true child, no words are
      needed. For he will have known the awe that falls on one in the presence
      of a spirit fresh from</i> <span class="smcap">God's</span> <i>hands, on
      whom no shadow of sin, and but the outermost fringe of the shadow of
      sorrow, has yet fallen: he will have felt the bitter contrast between the
      haunting selfishness that spoils his best deeds and the life that is but
      an overflowing love—for I think a child's</i> first <i>attitude to
      the world is a simple love for all living things: and he will have learned
      that the best work a man can do is when he works for love's sake only,
      with no thought of name, or gain, or earthly reward. No deed of ours, I
      suppose, on this side the grave, is really unselfish: yet if one can put
      forth all one's powers in a task where nothing of reward is hoped for but
      a little child's whispered thanks, and the airy touch of a little child's
      pure lips, one seems to come somewhere near to this.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>There was no idea of publication in my mind when I wrote this little
      book</i>: that <i>was wholly an afterthought, pressed on me by the
      "perhaps too partial friends" who always have to bear the blame when a
      writer rushes into print: and I can truly say that no praise of theirs has
      ever given me one hundredth part of the pleasure it has been to think of
      the sick children in hospitals (where it has been a delight to me to send
      copies) forgetting, for a few bright hours, their pain and weariness—perhaps
      thinking lovingly of the unknown writer of the tale—perhaps even
      putting up a childish prayer (and oh, how much it needs!) for one who can
      but dimly hope to stand, some day, not quite out of sight of those pure
      young faces, before the great white throne. "I am very sure," writes a
      lady-visitor at a Home for Sick Children, "that there will be many loving
      earnest prayers for you on Easter morning from the children.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I would like to quote further from her letters, as embodying a
      suggestion that may perhaps thus come to the notice of some one able and
      willing to carry it out.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I want you to send me one of your Easter Greetings for a very dear
      child who is dying at our Home. She is just fading away, and 'Alice' has
      brightened some of the weary hours in her illness, and I know that letter
      would be such a delight to her—especially if you would put 'Minnie'
      at the top, and she could know you had sent it for her.</i> She <i>knows</i>
      you, <i>and would so value it.... She suffers so much that I long for what
      I know would so please her." ... "Thank you very much for sending me the
      letter, and for writing Minnie's name.... I am quite sure that all these
      children will say a loving prayer for the 'Alice-man' on Easter Day: and I
      am sure the letter will help the little ones to the real Easter joy. How I
      do wish that you, who have won the hearts and confidence of so many
      children, would do for them what is so very near my heart, and yet what no
      one will do, viz. write a book for children about</i> <span class="smcap">God</span>
      <i>and themselves, which is</i> not <i>goody, and which begins at the
      right end, about religion, to make them see what it really is. I get quite
      miserable very often over the children I come across: hardly any of them
      have an idea of</i> really <i>knowing that</i> <span class="smcap">God</span>
      <i>loves them, or of loving and confiding in Him. They will love and trust</i>
      me, <i>and be sure that I want them to be happy, and will not let them
      suffer more than is necessary: but as for going to Him in the same way,
      they would never think of it. They are dreadfully afraid of Him, if they
      think of Him at all, which they generally only do when they have been
      naughty, and they look on all connected with Him as very grave and dull:
      and, when they are full of fun and thoroughly happy, I am sure they
      unconsciously hope He is not looking. I am sure I don't wonder they think
      of Him in this way, for people</i> never <i>talk of Him in connection with
      what makes their little lives the brightest. If they are naughty, people
      put on solemn faces, and say He is very angry or shocked, or something
      which frightens them: and, for the rest, He is talked about only in a way
      that makes them think of church and having to be quiet. As for being
      taught that all Joy and all Gladness and Brightness is His Joy—that
      He is wearying for them to be happy, and is not hard and stern, but always
      doing things to make their days brighter, and caring for them so tenderly,
      and wanting them to run to Him with</i> all <i>their little joys and
      sorrows, they are not taught that. I do so long to make them trust Him as
      they trust us, to feel that He will 'take their part' as they do with us
      in their little woes, and to go to Him in their plays and enjoyments and
      not only when they say their prayers. I was quite grateful to one little
      dot, a short time ago, who said to his mother 'when I am in bed, I put out
      my hand to see if I can feel</i> <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> <i>and
      my angel. I thought perhaps</i> in the dark <i>they'd touch me, but they
      never have yet.' I do so want them to</i> want <i>to go to Him, and to
      feel how, if He is there, it</i> must <i>be happy.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Let me add—for I feel I have drifted into far too serious a vein
      for a preface to a fairy-tale—the deliciously naïve remark of a
      very dear child-friend, whom I asked, after an acquaintance of two or
      three days, if she had read 'Alice' and the 'Looking-Glass.' "Oh yes," she
      replied readily, "I've read both of them! And I think" (this more slowly
      and thoughtfully) "I think 'Through the Looking-Glass' is</i> more <i>stupid
      than 'Alice's Adventures.' Don't</i> you <i>think so?" But this was a
      question I felt it would be hardly discreet for me to enter upon.</i>

      AN EASTER GREETING
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO
    </h3>
    <h3>
      EVERY CHILD WHO LOVES
    </h3>
    <h2>
      "Alice."
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Dear Child</span>,
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Please to fancy, if you can, that you are reading a real letter, from a
      real friend whom you have seen, and whose voice you can seem to yourself
      to hear wishing you, as I do now with all my heart, a happy Easter.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Do you know that delicious dreamy feeling when one first wakes on a
      summer morning, with the twitter of birds in the air, and the fresh breeze
      coming in at the open window—when, lying lazily with eyes half shut,
      one sees as in a dream green boughs waving, or waters rippling in a golden
      light? It is a pleasure very near to sadness, bringing tears to one's eyes
      like a beautiful picture or poem. And is not that a Mother's gentle hand
      that undraws your curtains, and a Mother's sweet voice that summons you to
      rise? To rise and forget, in the bright sunlight, the ugly dreams that
      frightened you so when all was dark—to rise and enjoy another happy
      day, first kneeling to thank that unseen Friend, who sends you the
      beautiful sun</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Are these strange words from a writer of such tales as "Alice"? And is
      this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense? It may be so. Some
      perhaps may blame me for thus mixing together things grave and gay; others
      may smile and think it odd that any one should speak of solemn things at
      all, except in church and on a Sunday: but I think—nay, I am sure—that
      some children will read this gently and lovingly, and in the spirit in
      which I have written it.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>For I do not believe God means us thus to divide life into two halves—to
      wear a grave face on Sunday, and to think it out-of-place to even so much
      as mention Him on a week-day. Do you think He cares to see only kneeling
      figures, and to hear only tones of prayer—and that He does not also
      love to see the lambs leaping in the sunlight, and to hear the merry
      voices of the children, as they roll among the hay? Surely their innocent
      laughter is as sweet in His ears as the grandest anthem that ever rolled
      up from the "dim religious light" of some solemn cathedral?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>And if I have written anything to add to those stores of innocent and
      healthy amusement that are laid up in books for the children I love so
      well, it is surely something I may hope to look back upon without shame
      and sorrow (as how much of life must then be recalled!) when</i> my <i>turn
      comes to walk through the valley of shadows.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>This Easter sun will rise on you, dear child, feeling your "life in
      every limb," and eager to rush out into the fresh morning air</i>—<i>and
      many an Easter-day will come and go, before it finds you feeble and
      gray-headed, creeping wearily out to bask once more in the sunlight—but
      it is good, even now, to think sometimes of that great morning when the
      "Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Surely your gladness need not be the less for the thought that you will
      one day see a brighter dawn than this—when lovelier sights will meet
      your eyes than any waving trees or rippling waters—when angel-hands
      shall undraw your curtains, and sweeter tones than ever loving Mother
      breathed shall wake you to a new and glorious day—and when all the
      sadness, and the sin, that darkened life on this little earth, shall be
      forgotten like the dreams of a night that is past!</i>

      </h2>
      <p class="font">
        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
        book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
        it, and where is the use of a book, thought Alice, without pictures or
        conversations? So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she
        could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether
        the pleasure of making a daisy-chain was worth the trouble of getting up
        and picking the daisies, when a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by
        her.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        There was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so
        very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself "dear, dear! I
        shall be too late!" (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to
        her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all
        seemed quite natural); but when the rabbit actually <span class="u">took
        a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</span>, looked at it, and then
        hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_2" id="CPage_2">[2]</a></span> it flashed across her mind
        that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket
        or a watch to take out of it, and, full of curiosity, she hurried across
        the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large
        rabbit-hole under the hedge. In a moment down went Alice after it, never
        once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
        dipped suddenly down, so suddenly, that Alice had not a moment to think
        about stopping herself, before she found herself falling down what
        seemed a deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very
        slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her,
        and to wonder what would happen next. First, she tried to look down and
        make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything:
        then, she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were
        filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there were maps and
        pictures hung on pegs. She took a jar down off one of the shelves as she
        passed: it was labelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_3" id="CPage_3">[3]</a></span> "Orange Marmalade," but to her great
        disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear
        of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
        cupboards as she fell past it.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Well!" thought Alice to herself, "after such a fall as this, I shall
        think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
        home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
        of the house!" (which was most likely true.)
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Down, down, down. Would the fall <span class="u">never</span> come to an
        end? "I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud,
        "I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see:
        that would be four thousand miles down, I think—" (for you see
        Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the
        schoolroom, and though this was not a <span class="u">very</span> good
        opportunity of showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to hear
        her, still it was good practice to say it over,) "yes that's the right
        distance, but then what Longitude or Latitude-line shall I be in?"
        (Alice had no idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_4" id="CPage_4">[4]</a></span>
        what Longitude was, or Latitude either, but she thought they were nice
        grand words to say.)
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Presently she began again: "I wonder if I shall fall right <span class="u">through</span> the earth! How funny it'll be to come out among
        the people that walk with their heads downwards! But I shall have to ask
        them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this
        New Zealand or Australia?"—and she tried to curtsey as she spoke
        (fancy <span class="u">curtseying</span> as you're falling through the
        air! do you think you could manage it?) "and what an ignorant little
        girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I
        shall see it written up somewhere."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Down, down, down: there was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
        talking again. "Dinah will miss me very much tonight, I should think!"
        (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
        tea-time! Oh, dear Dinah, I wish I had you here! There are no mice in
        the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a
        mouse, you know, my dear. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?" And here
        Alice began to get rather sleepy, and kept on saying to herself, in a
        dreamy sort of way "do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats?" and sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_5" id="CPage_5">[5]</a></span> "do bats
        eat cats?" for, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much
        matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had
        just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and
        was saying to her very earnestly, "Now, Dinah, my dear, tell me the
        truth. Did you ever eat a bat?" when suddenly, bump! bump! down she came
        upon a heap of sticks and shavings, and the fall was over.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Alice was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she looked
        up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage,
        and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not
        a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and just heard it
        say, as it turned a corner, "my ears and whiskers, how late it's
        getting!" She turned the corner after it, and instantly found herself in
        a long, low hall, lit up by a row of lamps which hung from the roof.
      </p>
      <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_006.jpg" width="300" height="337" alt="Illustration">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when
        Alice had been all round it, and tried them all, she walked sadly down
        the middle, wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_6" id="CPage_6">[6]</a></span>
        how she was ever to get out again: suddenly she came upon a little
        three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing lying
        upon it, but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that it might
        belong to one of the doors of the hall, but alas! either the locks were
        too large, or the key too small, but at any rate it would open none of
        them. However, on the second time round, she came to a low curtain,
        behind which was a door about eighteen inches high: she tried the little
        key in the keyhole, and it fitted! Alice opened the door, and looked
        down a small passage, not larger than a rat-hole, into the loveliest
        garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and
        wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool
        fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway, "and
        even if my head would go through," thought poor Alice, "it would be very
        little use <span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_7" id="CPage_7">[7]</a></span>without
        my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I
        could, if I only knew how to begin." For, you see, so many
        out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice began to think
        very few things indeed were really impossible.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        There was nothing else to do, so she went back to the table, half hoping
        she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for
        shutting up people like telescopes: this time there was a little bottle
        on it—"which certainly was not there before" said Alice—and
        tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words <b>DRINK
        ME</b> beautifully printed on it in large letters.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        It was all very well to say "drink me," "but I'll look first," said the
        wise little Alice, "and see whether the bottle's marked "poison" or
        not," for Alice had read several nice little stories about children that
        got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things,
        because they <span class="u">would</span> not remember the simple rules
        their friends had given them, such as, that, if you get into the fire,
        it will burn you, and that, if you cut your finger very deeply with a
        knife, it generally bleeds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_8" id="CPage_8">[8]</a></span> she had never forgotten that, if you drink a
        bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you,
        sooner or later.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        However, this bottle was <span class="u">not</span> marked poison, so
        Alice tasted it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of
        mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy,
        and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
      </p>
      <hr style="width: 45%;">
      <p class="font">
        "What a curious feeling!" said Alice, "I must be shutting up like a
        telescope."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        It was so indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
        brightened up as it occurred to her that she was now the right size for
        going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however,
        she waited for a few minutes to see whether she was going to shrink any
        further: she felt a little nervous about this, "for it might end, you
        know," said Alice to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a
        candle, and what should I be like then, I wonder?" and she tried to
        fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_9" id="CPage_9">[9]</a></span> for she
        could not remember having ever seen one. However, nothing more happened
        so she decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor
        Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little
        golden key, and when she went back to the table for the key, she found
        she could not possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through
        the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the
        table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with
        trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
      </p>
      <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_009.jpg" width="300" height="264" alt="Illustration">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        "Come! there's no use in crying!" said Alice to herself rather sharply,
        "I advise you to leave off this minute!" (she generally gave herself
        very good advice, and sometimes scolded herself so severely as to bring
        tears into her eyes, and once she remembered boxing her own ears for
        having been unkind to herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_10" id="CPage_10">[10]</a></span> in a game of croquet she was playing with
        herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two
        people,) "but it's no use now," thought poor Alice, "to pretend to be
        two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one
        respectable person!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Soon her eyes fell on a little ebony box lying under the table: she
        opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which was lying a card
        with the words <b>EAT ME</b> beautifully printed on it in large letters.
        "I'll eat," said Alice, "and if it makes me larger, I can reach the key,
        and if it makes me smaller, I can creep under the door, so either way
        I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself "which way? which
        way?" and laid her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
        growing, and was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
        size: to be sure this is what generally happens when one eats cake, but
        Alice had got into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the way
        things to happen, and it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_11" id="CPage_11">[11]</a></span> quite dull and stupid for things to go on
        in the common way.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
      </p>
      <hr style="width: 45%;">
      <p class="font">
        "Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice, (she was so surprised that she
        quite forgot how to speak good English,) "now I'm opening out like the
        largest telescope that ever was! Goodbye, feet!" (for when she looked
        down at her feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they were getting so
        far off,) "oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes
        and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I can't! I shall be a great
        deal too far off to bother myself about you: you must manage the best
        way you can—but I must be kind to them," thought Alice, "or
        perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them
        a new pair of boots every Christmas."

        must go by the carrier," she thought, "and how funny it'll seem, sending

        oh dear! what nonsense I am talking!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Just at this moment, her head struck against the roof of the hall: in
        fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took
        up the little golden key, and hurried off to the garden door.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Poor Alice! it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
        look through into the garden with one eye, but to get through was more
        hopeless than ever: she sat down and cried again.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Alice, "a great girl like
        you," (she might well say this,) "to cry in this way! Stop this instant,
        I tell you!" But she cried on all the same, shedding gallons of tears,
        until there was a large pool, about four inches deep, all round her, and
        reaching half way across the hall. After a time, she heard a little
        pattering of feet in the distance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_13" id="CPage_13">[13]</a></span> dried her eyes to see what
        was coming. It was the white rabbit coming back again, splendidly
        dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand, and a nosegay in
        the other. Alice was ready to ask help of any one, she felt so
        desperate, and as the rabbit passed her, she said, in a low, timid
        voice, "If you please, Sir—" the rabbit started violently, looked
        up once into the roof of the hall, from which the voice seemed to come,
        and then dropped the nosegay and the white kid gloves, and skurried away
        into the darkness, as hard as it could go.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p class="font">
        Alice took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so delicious
        that she kept smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself—"dear,
        dear! how queer everything is today! and yesterday everything happened
        just as usual: I wonder if I was changed in the night? Let me think: was
        I the same when I got up this morning? I think I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_14" id="CPage_14">[14]</a></span> feeling
        rather different. But if I'm not the same, who in the world am I? Ah,
        that's the great puzzle!" And she began thinking over all the children
        she knew of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been
        changed for any of them.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I'm sure I'm not Gertrude," she said, "for her hair goes in such long
        ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all—and I'm sure I
        ca'n't be Florence, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she
        knows such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and—oh
        dear! how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used
        to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is
        thirteen, and four times seven is fourteen—oh dear! I shall never
        get to twenty at this rate! But the Multiplication Table don't signify—let's
        try Geography. London is the capital of France, and Rome is the capital
        of Yorkshire, and Paris—oh dear! dear! <span class="u">that's</span>
        all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for Florence! I'll try
        and say "How doth the little,"" and she crossed her hands on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_15" id="CPage_15">[15]</a></span> lap,
        and began, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did
        not sound the same as they used to do:
      </p>
      <div class="poem font">
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="i0">"How doth the little crocodile<br></span> <span class="i2">Improve its shining tail,<br></span> <span class="i0">And

          gently-smiling jaws!"<br></span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        "I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor Alice, and her eyes
        filled with tears as she thought "I must be Florence after all, and I
        shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no
        toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No! I've made
        up my mind about it: if I'm Florence, I'll stay down here! It'll be no
        use their putting their heads down and saying 'come <span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_16" id="CPage_16">[16]</a></span>up, dear!' I shall only
        look up and say 'who am I then? answer me that first, and then, if I
        like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till
        I'm somebody else—but, oh dear!" cried Alice with a sudden burst
        of tears, "I do wish they <span class="u">would</span> put their heads
        down! I am so tired of being all alone here!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        As she said this, she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to
        find she had put on one of the rabbit's little gloves while she was
        talking. "How <span class="u">can</span> I have done that?" thought she,
        "I must be growing small again." She got up and went to the table to
        measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she
        was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: soon
        she found out that the reason of it was the nosegay she held in her
        hand: she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from
        shrinking away altogether, and found that she was now only three inches
        high.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Now for the garden!" cried Alice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_17" id="CPage_17">[17]</a></span> as she hurried back to the
        little door, but the little door was locked again, and the little gold
        key was lying on the glass table as before, and "things are worse than
        ever!" thought the poor little girl, "for I never was as small as this
        before, never! And I declare it's too bad, it is!"
      </p>
      <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

      </div>
      <p class="font">
        At this moment her foot slipped, and splash! she was up to her chin in
        salt water. Her first idea was that she had fallen into the sea: then
        she remembered that she was under ground, and she soon made out that it
        was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high. "I wish
        I hadn't cried so much!" said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find
        her way out, "I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being
        drowned in my own tears! Well! that'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_18" id="CPage_18">[18]</a></span> be a queer thing, to be
        sure! However, every thing is queer today." Very soon she saw something
        splashing about in the pool near her: at first she thought it must be a
        walrus or a hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was
        herself, and soon made out that it was only a mouse, that had slipped in
        like herself.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Would it be any use, now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse? The
        rabbit is something quite out-of-the-way, no doubt, and so have I been,
        ever since I came down here, but that is no reason why the mouse should
        not be able to talk. I think I may as well try."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        So she began: "oh Mouse, do you know how to get out of this pool? I am
        very tired of swimming about here, oh Mouse!" The mouse looked at her
        rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
        eyes, but it said nothing.
      </p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
        <img class="img1" src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_019.jpg" width="600" height="318" alt="Illustration">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        "Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice; "I daresay it's
        a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror!" (for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_20" id="CPage_20">[20]</a></span>with all
        her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
        anything had happened,) so she began again: "où est ma chatte?"
        which was the first sentence out of her French lesson-book. The mouse
        gave a sudden jump in the pool, and seemed to quiver with fright: "oh, I
        beg your pardon!" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor
        animal's feelings, "I quite forgot you didn't like cats!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Not like cats!" cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice, "would
        <span class="u">you</span> like cats if you were me?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone, "don't be angry
        about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
        take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
        thing," said Alice, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
        pool, "she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
        washing her face: and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse, and she's
        such a capital one for catching mice—oh! I beg your pardon!" cried
        poor Alice<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_21" id="CPage_21">[21]</a></span>
        again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt
        certain that it was really offended, "have I offended you?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Offended indeed!" cried the mouse, who seemed to be positively
        trembling with rage, "our family always <span class="u">hated</span>
        cats! Nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't talk to me about them any more!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I won't indeed!" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the
        conversation, "are you—are you—fond of—dogs?" The
        mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: "there is such a nice
        little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little
        bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh! such long curly brown hair! And
        it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its
        dinner, and all sorts of things—I ca'n't remember half of them—and
        it belongs to a farmer, and he says it kills all the rats and—oh
        dear!" said Alice sadly, "I'm afraid I've offended it again!" for the
        mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making
        quite a commotion in the pool as it went.<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_22" id="CPage_22">[22]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        So she called softly after it: "mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
        won't talk about cats and dogs any more, if you don't like them!" When
        the mouse heard this, it turned and swam slowly back to her: its face
        was quite pale, (with passion, Alice thought,) and it said in a
        trembling low voice "let's get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
        history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of birds and
        animals that had fallen into it. There was a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and
        an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and
        the whole party swam to the shore.

      <p class="font">
        They were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the bank—the
        birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
        to them—all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. The first
        question of course was, how to get dry: they had a consultation about
        this, and Alice hardly felt at all surprised at finding herself talking
        familiarly with the birds, as if she had known them all her life.
        Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned
        sulky, and would only say "I am older than you, and must know best," and
        this Alice would not admit without knowing how old the Lory was, and as
        the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was nothing more to
        be said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_25" id="CPage_25">[25]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        At last the mouse, who seemed to have some authority among them, called
        out "sit down, all of you, and attend to me! I'll soon make you dry
        enough!" They all sat down at once, shivering, in a large ring, Alice in
        the middle, with her eyes anxiously fixed on the mouse, for she felt
        sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Ahem!" said the mouse, with a self-important air, "are you all ready?
        This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon
        submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late
        much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls
        of Mercia and Northumbria—"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Ugh!" said the Lory with a shiver.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I beg your pardon?" said the mouse, frowning, but very politely, "did
        you speak?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Not I!" said the Lory hastily.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I thought you did," said the mouse, "I proceed. Edwin and Morcar, the
        earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_26" id="CPage_26">[26]</a></span> and even Stigand, the
        patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable to go with Edgar
        Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William's conduct was
        at first moderate—how are you getting on now, dear?" said the
        mouse, turning to Alice as it spoke.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "As wet as ever," said poor Alice, "it doesn't seem to dry me at all."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to his feet, "I move that
        the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
        remedies—"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Speak English!" said the Duck, "I don't know the meaning of half those
        long words, and what's more, I don't believe you do either!" And the
        Duck quacked a comfortable laugh to itself. Some of the other birds
        tittered audibly.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I only meant to say," said the Dodo in a rather offended tone, "that I
        know of a house near here, where we could get the young lady and the
        rest of the party dried, and then we could listen comfortably to the
        story which I think you were good enough to promise to tell us," bowing
        gravely to the mouse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_27" id="CPage_27">[27]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        The mouse made no objection to this, and the whole party moved along the
        river bank, (for the pool had by this time began to flow out of the
        hall, and the edge of it was fringed with rushes and forget-me-nots,) in
        a slow procession, the Dodo leading the way. After a time the Dodo
        became impatient, and, leaving the Duck to bring up the rest of the
        party, moved on at a quicker pace with Alice, the Lory, and the Eaglet,
        and soon brought them to a little cottage, and there they sat snugly by
        the fire, wrapped up in blankets, until the rest of the party had
        arrived, and they were all dry again.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank, and begged the
        mouse to begin his story.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Mine is a long and a sad tale!" said the mouse, turning to Alice, and
        sighing.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "It <span class="u">is</span> a long tail, certainly," said Alice,
        looking down with wonder at the mouse's tail, which was coiled nearly
        all round the party, "but why do you call it sad?" and she went on
        puzzling about this as the mouse went on speaking, so that her idea of
        the tale was something like this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_28" id="CPage_28">[28]</a></span>

        "You are not attending!" said the mouse to Alice severely, "what are you
        thinking of?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I beg your pardon," said Alice very humbly, "you had got to the fifth
        bend, I think?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I had not!" cried the mouse, sharply and very angrily.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "A knot!" said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
        anxiously about her, "oh, do let me help to undo it!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I shall do nothing of the sort!" said the mouse, getting up and walking
        away from the party, "you insult me by talking such nonsense!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I didn't mean it!" pleaded poor Alice, "but you're so easily offended,
        you know."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        The mouse only growled in reply.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Please come back and finish your story!" Alice called after it, and the
        others all joined in chorus "yes, please do!" but the mouse only shook
        its ears, and walked quickly away, and was soon out of sight.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sighed the Lory, and an old Crab took
        the opportunity of saying to its daughter "Ah, my dear!<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_30" id="CPage_30">[30]</a></span> let
        this be a lesson to you never to lose <span class="u">your</span>
        temper!" "Hold your tongue, Ma!" said the young Crab, a little
        snappishly, "you're enough to try the patience of an oyster!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!" said Alice aloud, addressing
        no one in particular, "she'd soon fetch it back!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?" said the
        Lory.
      </p>

      <p class="font">
        Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet,
        "Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice, you
        can't think! And oh! I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
        she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        This answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party: some of the
        birds hurried off at once; one old magpie began wrapping itself up very
        carefully, remarking "I really must be getting home: the night air does
        not suit my throat," and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its
        children "come away from her, my dears, she's no fit company for you!"
        On various pretexts, they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

        She sat for some while sorrowful and silent, but she was not long before
        she recovered her spirits, and began talking to herself again as usual:
        "I do wish some of them had stayed a little longer! and I was getting to
        be such friends with them—really the Lory and I were almost like
        sisters! and so was that dear little Eaglet! And then the Duck and the
        Dodo! How nicely the Duck sang to us as we came along through the water:
        and if the Dodo hadn't known the way to that nice little cottage, I
        don't know when we should have got dry again—" and there is no
        knowing how long she might have prattled on in this way, if she had not
        suddenly caught the sound of pattering feet.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        It was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
        anxiously about it as it went, as if it had lost something, and she
        heard it muttering to itself "the Marchioness! the Marchioness! oh my
        dear paws! oh my fur and whiskers! She'll have me executed, as sure as
        ferrets<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_33" id="CPage_33">[33]</a></span>
        are ferrets! Where <span class="u">can</span> I have dropped them, I
        wonder?" Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the nosegay
        and the pair of white kid gloves, and she began hunting for them, but
        they were now nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed
        since her swim in the pool, and her walk along the river-bank with its
        fringe of rushes and forget-me-nots, and the glass table and the little
        door had vanished.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Soon the rabbit noticed Alice, as she stood looking curiously about her,
        and at once said in a quick angry tone, "why, Mary Ann! what <span class="u">are</span> you doing out here? Go home this moment, and look
        on my dressing-table for my gloves and nosegay, and fetch them here, as
        quick as you can run, do you hear?" and Alice was so much frightened
        that she ran off at once, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_34" id="CPage_34">[34]</a></span> saying a word, in the direction which the
        rabbit had pointed out.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        She soon found herself in front of a neat little house, on the door of
        which was a bright brass plate with the name <b>W. RABBIT, ESQ.</b> She
        went in, and hurried upstairs, for fear she should meet the real Mary
        Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the gloves: she
        knew that one pair had been lost in the hall, "but of course," thought
        Alice, "it has plenty more of them in its house. How queer it seems to
        be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me
        messages next!" And she began fancying the sort of things that would
        happen: "Miss Alice! come here directly and get ready for your walk!"
        "Coming in a minute, nurse! but I've got to watch this mousehole till
        Dinah comes back, and see that the mouse doesn't get out—" "only I
        don't think," Alice went on, "that they'd let Dinah stop in the house,
        if it began ordering people about like that!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_35" id="CPage_35">[35]</a></span>
      </p>
      <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

      </div>
      <p class="font">
        By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room, with a table
        in the window on which was a looking-glass and, (as Alice had hoped,)
        two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up a pair of
        gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
        little bottle that stood near the looking-glass: there was no label on
        it this time with the words "drink me," but nonetheless she uncorked it
        and put it to her lips: "I know something interesting is sure to
        happen," she said to herself, "whenever I eat or drink anything, so I'll
        see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow larger, for I'm
        quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        It did so indeed, and much sooner<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_36" id="CPage_36">[36]</a></span> than she expected: before she had drunk
        half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and
        she stooped to save her neck from being broken, and hastily put down the
        bottle, saying to herself "that's quite enough—I hope I sha'n't
        grow any more—I wish I hadn't drunk so much!"
      </p>
      <div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_036.jpg" width="300" height="317" alt="Illustration">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        Alas! it was too late: she went on growing and growing, and very soon
        had to kneel down: in another minute there was not room even for this,
        and she tried the effect of lying down, with one elbow against the door,
        and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and
        as a last resource she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up
        the chimney, and said to herself "now I can do no more—what <span class="u">will</span> become of me?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_38" id="CPage_38">[38]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
        and she grew no larger; still it was very uncomfortable, and as there
        seemed to be no sort of chance of ever getting out of the room again, no
        wonder she felt unhappy. "It was much pleasanter at home," thought poor
        Alice, "when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being
        ordered about by mice and rabbits—I almost wish I hadn't gone down
        that rabbit-hole, and yet, and yet—it's rather curious, you know,
        this sort of life. I do wonder what <span class="u">can</span> have
        happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that sort of
        thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There out
        to be a book written about me, that there ought! and when I grow up I'll
        write one—but I'm grown up now" said she in a sorrowful tone, "at
        least there's no room to grow up any more <span class="u">here</span>."
      </p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_037.jpg" alt="Illustration" width="600" height="322" class="img1">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        "But then," thought Alice, "shall I <span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_39" id="CPage_39">[39]</a></span><span class="u">never</span>
        get any older than I am now? That'll be a comfort, one way—never
        to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn!
        Oh, I shouldn't like <span class="u">that</span>!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Oh, you foolish Alice!" she said again, "how can you learn lessons in
        here? Why, there's hardly room for you, and no room at all for any
        lesson-books!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        And so she went on, taking first one side, and then the other, and
        making quite a conversation of it altogether, but after a few minutes
        she heard a voice outside, which made her stop to listen.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Mary Ann! Mary Ann!" said the voice, "fetch me my gloves this moment!"
        Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs: Alice knew it was
        the rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
        house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
        as the rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it. Presently the
        rabbit came to the door, and tried to open it, but as it opened inwards,
        and Alice's elbow was against it, the attempt proved a failure. Alice
        heard it<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_40" id="CPage_40">[40]</a></span>
        say to itself "then I'll go round and get in at the window."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "<span class="u">That</span> you wo'n't!" thought Alice, and, after
        waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit, just under the window,
        she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did
        not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a
        crash of breaking glass, from which she concluded that it was just
        possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
      </p>
      <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_040.jpg" width="300" height="319" alt="Illustration">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        Next came an angry voice—the rabbit's—"Pat, Pat! where are
        you?" And then a voice she had never heard before, "shure then I'm here!
        digging for apples, anyway, yer honour!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Digging for apples indeed!" said the rabbit angrily, "here, come and
        help me<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_41" id="CPage_41">[41]</a></span>
        out of <span class="u">this</span>!"—Sound of more breaking glass.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Now, tell me, Pat, what is that coming out of the window?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Shure it's an arm, yer honour!" (He pronounced it "arrum".)
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "An arm, you goose! Who ever saw an arm that size? Why, it fills the
        whole window, don't you see?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Shure, it does, yer honour, but it's an arm for all that."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Well, it's no business there: go and take it away!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
        now and then, such as "shure I don't like it, yer honour, at all at
        all!" "do as I tell you, you coward!" and at last she spread out her
        hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
        <span class="u">two</span> little shrieks, and more breaking glass—"what
        a number of cucumber-frames there must be!" thought Alice, "I wonder
        what they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish
        they <span class="u">could</span>! I'm sure <span class="u">I</span>
        don't want to stop in here any longer!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        She waited for some time without<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_42" id="CPage_42">[42]</a></span> hearing anything more: at last came a
        rumbling of little cart-wheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
        talking together: she made out the words "where's the other ladder?—why,
        I hadn't to bring but one, Bill's got the other—here, put 'em up
        at this corner—no, tie 'em together first—they don't reach
        high enough yet—oh, they'll do well enough, don't be particular—here,
        Bill! catch hold of this rope—will the roof bear?—mind that
        loose slate—oh, it's coming down! heads below!—" (a loud
        crash) "now, who did that?—it was Bill, I fancy—who's to go
        down the chimney?—nay, <span class="u">I</span> sha'n't! <span class="u">you</span> do it!—<span class="u">that</span> I won't
        then—Bill's got to go down—here, Bill! the master says
        you've to go down the chimney!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Oh, so Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?" said Alice to
        herself, "why, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
        Bill's place for a good deal: the fireplace is a pretty tight one, but I
        <span class="u">think</span> I can kick a little!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
        she<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_43" id="CPage_43">[43]</a></span>
        heard a little animal (she couldn't guess what sort it was) scratching
        and scrambling in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself
        "this is Bill," she gave one sharp kick, and waited again to see what
        would happen next.
      </p>
      <div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_043.jpg" width="300" height="325" alt="Illustration">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        The first thing was a general chorus of "there goes Bill!" then the
        rabbit's voice alone "catch him, you by the hedge!" then silence, and
        then another confusion of voices, "how was it, old fellow? what happened
        to you? tell us all about it."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Last came a little feeble squeaking voice, ("that's Bill" thought
        Alice,) which said "well, I hardly know—I'm all of a fluster
        myself—something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and the next
        minute up I goes like a rocket!" "And so you did, old fellow!" said the
        other voices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_44" id="CPage_44">[44]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "We must burn the house down!" said the voice of the rabbit, and Alice
        called out as loud as she could "if you do, I'll set Dinah at you!" This
        caused silence again, and while Alice was thinking "but how can I get
        Dinah here?" she found to her great delight that she was getting
        smaller: very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable
        position in which she had been lying, and in two or three minutes more
        she was once more three inches high.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        She ran out of the house as quick as she could, and found quite a crowd
        of little animals waiting outside—guinea-pigs, white mice,
        squirrels, and "Bill" a little green lizard, that was being supported in
        the arms of one of the guinea-pigs, while another was giving it
        something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at her the moment she
        appeared, but Alice ran her hardest, and soon found herself in a thick
        wood.

      </h2>
      <p class="font">
        "The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself, as she wandered
        about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size, and the second thing is
        to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best
        plan."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
        arranged: the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
        how to set about it, and while she was peering anxiously among the trees
        round her, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
        great hurry.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
        feebly stretching out one paw, trying to reach her: "poor thing!" said
        Alice in a coaxing tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_47" id="CPage_47">[47]</a></span> and she tried hard to whistle to it, but
        she was terribly alarmed all the while at the thought that it might be
        hungry, in which case it would probably devour her in spite of all her
        coaxing. Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of
        stick, and held it out to the puppy: whereupon the puppy jumped into the
        air off all its feet at once, and with a yelp of delight rushed at the
        stick, and made believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great
        thistle to keep herself from being run over, and, the moment she
        appeared at the other side, the puppy made another dart at the stick,
        and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold: then Alice,
        thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and
        expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the
        thistle again: then the puppy begin a series of short charges at the
        stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back,
        and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way
        off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great
        eyes half shut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_48" id="CPage_48">[48]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape. She set
        off at once, and ran till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the
        distance, and till she was quite tired and out of breath.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "And yet what a dear little puppy it was!" said Alice, as she leant
        against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with her hat. "I
        should have liked teaching it tricks, if—if I'd only been the
        right size to do it! Oh! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up
        again! Let me see; how <i>is</i> it to be managed? I suppose I ought to
        eat or drink something or other, but the great question is what?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
        the flowers and the blades of grass but could not see anything that
        looked like the right thing to eat under the circumstances. There was a
        large mushroom near her, about the same height as herself, and when she
        had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred
        to her to look and see what was on the top of it.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
        mushroom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_49" id="CPage_49">[49]</a></span>
        and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, which
        was sitting with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and
        taking not the least notice of her or of anything else.
      </p>
      <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_049.jpg" width="300" height="356" alt="Illustration">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        For some time they looked at each other in silence: at last the
        caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and languidly addressed
        her.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Who are you?" said the caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation: Alice replied
        rather shyly, "I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at
        least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must
        have been changed several times since that."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "What do you mean by that?" said the caterpillar, "explain yourself!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I ca'n't explain <span class="u">myself</span>, I'm afraid, sir,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_50" id="CPage_50">[50]</a></span> said
        Alice, "because I'm not myself, you see."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I don't see," said the caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," Alice replied very politely,
        "for I ca'n't understand it myself, and really to be so many different
        sizes in one day is very confusing."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "It isn't," said the caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said Alice, "but when you
        have to turn into a chrysalis, you know, and then after that into a
        butterfly, I should think it'll feel a little queer, don't you think
        so?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Not a bit," said the caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "All I know is," said Alice, "it would feel queer to <span class="u">me</span>."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "<span class="u">You</span>!" said the caterpillar contemptuously, "who
        are you?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation:
        Alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar making such very short
        remarks, and she drew herself up and said very gravely "I think you
        ought to tell me who <span class="u">you</span> are, first."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Why?" said the caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Here was another puzzling question:<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_51" id="CPage_51">[51]</a></span> and as Alice had no reason
        ready, and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very bad temper, she turned
        round and walked away.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Come back!" the caterpillar called after her, "I've something important
        to say!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        This sounded promising: Alice turned and came back again.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Keep your temper," said the caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Is that all?" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
        could.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "No," said the caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
        perhaps after all the caterpillar might tell her something worth
        hearing. For some minutes it puffed away at its hookah without speaking,
        but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth
        again, and said "so you think you're changed, do you?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Yes, sir," said Alice, "I ca'n't remember the things I used to know—I've
        tried to say "How doth the little busy bee" and it came all different!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Try and repeat "You are old, father William"," said the caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Alice folded her hands, and began:

        have got altered."

        "It is wrong from beginning to end," said the caterpillar decidedly, and
        there was silence for some minutes: the caterpillar was the first to
        speak.

      <p class="font">
        "What size do you want to be?" it asked.

      <p class="font">
        "Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily replied, "only one
        doesn't like changing so often, you know."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Are you content now?" said the caterpillar.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Well, I should like to be a <span class="u">little</span> larger, sir,
        if you wouldn't mind," said Alice, "three inches is such a wretched
        height to be."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "It is a very good height indeed!" said the caterpillar loudly and
        angrily, rearing itself straight up as it spoke (it was exactly three
        inches high).
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "But I'm not used to it!" pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone, and she
        thought to herself "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
        offended!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "You'll get used to it in time," said the caterpillar, and it put the
        hookah into its mouth, and began smoking again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_61" id="CPage_61">[61]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        This time Alice waited quietly until it chose to speak again: in a few
        minutes the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and got down
        off the mushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking as
        it went; "the top will make you grow taller, and the stalk will make you
        grow shorter."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "The top of <span class="u">what</span>? the stalk of <span class="u">what</span>?"
        thought Alice.
      </p>

      <p class="font">
        "Of the mushroom," said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
        aloud, and in another moment was out of sight.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, and
        then picked it and carefully broke it in two, taking the stalk in one
        hand, and the top in the other.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "<span class="u">Which</span> does the stalk do?" she said, and nibbled
        a little bit of it to try; the next moment she felt a violent blow on
        her chin: it had struck her foot!<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_62" id="CPage_62">[62]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but as she
        did not shrink any further, and had not dropped the top of the mushroom,
        she did not give up hope yet. There was hardly room to open her mouth,
        with her chin pressing against her foot, but she did it at last, and
        managed to bite off a little bit of the top of the mushroom.

      <p class="font">
        "Come! my head's free at last!" said Alice in a tone of delight, which
        changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
        were nowhere to be seen: she looked down upon an immense length of neck,
        which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
        far below her.

        "What <span class="u">can</span> all that green stuff be?" said Alice,
        "and where <span class="u">have</span> my shoulders got to? And oh! my
        poor hands! how is it I ca'n't see you?" She was moving them about as
        she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little rustling
        among the leaves. Then she tried to bring her head down to her hands,
        and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in every
        direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in bending it down in
        a beautiful zig-zag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which
        she found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had been wandering
        in, when a sharp hiss made her draw back: a large pigeon had flown into
        her face, and was violently beating her with its wings.

      <p class="font">
        "Serpent!" screamed the pigeon.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I'm <span class="u">not</span> a serpent!" said Alice indignantly, "let
        me alone!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_64" id="CPage_64">[64]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I've tried every way!" the pigeon said desperately, with a kind of sob:
        "nothing seems to suit 'em!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I haven't the least idea what you mean," said Alice.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
        hedges," the pigeon went on without attending to her, "but them
        serpents! There's no pleasing 'em!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
        saying anything till the pigeon had finished.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs!" said the pigeon,
        "without being on the look out for serpents, day and night! Why, I
        haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I'm very sorry you've been annoyed," said Alice, beginning to see its
        meaning.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," said the pigeon
        raising its voice to a shriek, "and was just thinking I was free of 'em
        at last, they must needs come down from the sky! Ugh! Serpent!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "But I'm <span class="u">not</span> a serpent," said Alice, "I'm a—I'm
        a—"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Well! <span class="u">What</span> are you?" said the pigeon, "I see
        you're trying to invent something."<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_65" id="CPage_65">[65]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I—I'm a little girl," said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she
        remembered the number of changes she had gone through.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "A likely story indeed!" said the pigeon, "I've seen a good many of them
        in my time, but never <span class="u">one</span> with such a neck as
        yours! No, you're a serpent, I know <span class="u">that</span> well
        enough! I suppose you'll tell me next that you never tasted an egg!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I <span class="u">have</span> tasted eggs, certainly," said Alice, who
        was a very truthful child, "but indeed I do'n't want any of yours. I
        do'n't like them raw."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Well, be off, then!" said the pigeon, and settled down into its nest
        again. Alice crouched down among the trees, as well as she could, as her
        neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and several times she
        had to stop and untwist it. Soon she remembered the pieces of mushroom
        which she still held in her hands, and set to work very carefully,
        nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes
        taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing
        herself down to her usual size.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        It was so long since she had been of the right size that it felt quite
        strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_66" id="CPage_66">[66]</a></span>
        at first, but she got quite used to it in a minute or two, and began
        talking to herself as usual: "well! there's half my plan done now! How
        puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be,
        from one minute to another! However, I've got to my right size again:
        the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how <span class="u">is</span> that to be done, I wonder?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a doorway
        leading right into it. "That's very curious!" she thought, "but
        everything's curious today: I may as well go in." And in she went.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
        glass table: "now, I'll manage better this time" she said to herself,
        and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
        led into the garden. Then she set to work eating the pieces of mushroom
        till she was about fifteen inches high: then she walked down the little
        passage: and <span class="u">then</span>—she found herself at last
        in the beautiful garden, among the bright flowerbeds and the cool
        fountains.

      </h2>
      <p class="font">
        A large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses on it
        were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them
        red. This Alice thought a very curious thing, and she went near to watch
        them, and just as she came up she heard one of them say "look out, Five!
        Don't go splashing paint over me like that!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I couldn't help it," said Five in a sulky tone, "Seven jogged my
        elbow."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        On which Seven lifted up his head and said "that's right, Five! Always
        lay the blame on others!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "<span class="u">You'd</span> better not talk!" said Five, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_69" id="CPage_69">[69]</a></span> heard
        the Queen say only yesterday she thought of having you beheaded!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "What for?" said the one who had spoken first.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "That's not your business, Two!" said Seven.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Yes, it <span class="u">is</span> his business!" said Five, "and I'll
        tell him: it was for bringing in tulip-roots to the cook instead of
        potatoes."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun "well! Of all the unjust
        things—" when his eye fell upon Alice, and he stopped suddenly;
        the others looked round, and all of them took off their hats and bowed
        low.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Would you tell me, please," said Alice timidly, "why you are painting
        those roses?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Five and Seven looked at Two, but said nothing: Two began, in a low
        voice, "why, Miss, the fact is, this ought to have been a red rose tree,
        and we put a white one in by mistake, and if the Queen was to find it
        out, we should all have our heads cut off. So, you see, we're doing our
        best, before she comes, to—" At this moment Five, who had been
        looking anxiously across the garden called out "the Queen! the Queen!"
        and<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_70" id="CPage_70">[70]</a></span>
        the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces.
        There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to
        see the Queen.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
        three gardeners, flat and oblong, with their hands and feet at the
        corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all ornamented with
        diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
        the Royal children: there were ten of them, and the little dears came
        jumping merrily along, hand in hand, in couples: they were all
        ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly kings and queens,
        among whom Alice recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a
        hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by
        without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the
        King's crown on a cushion, and, last of all this grand procession, came
        <b>THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS</b>.
      </p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_071.jpg" alt="Illustration" width="600" height="317" class="img1">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
        at her, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_72" id="CPage_72">[72]</a></span>the
        Queen said severely "who is this?" She said it to the Knave of Hearts,
        who only bowed and smiled in reply.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Idiot!" said the Queen, turning up her nose, and asked Alice "what's
        your name?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "My name is Alice, so please your Majesty," said Alice boldly, for she
        thought to herself "why, they're only a pack of cards! I needn't be
        afraid of them!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Who are these?" said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners lying
        round the rose tree, for, as they were lying on their faces, and the
        pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could
        not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or
        three of her own children.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "How should <span class="u">I</span> know?" said Alice, surprised at her
        own courage, "it's no business of <span class="u">mine</span>."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
        minute, began in a voice of thunder "off with her—"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Nonsense!" said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
        silent.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        The King laid his hand upon her arm, and said timidly "remember, my
        dear! She is only a child!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_73" id="CPage_73">[73]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave "turn them
        over!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Get up!" said the Queen, in a shrill loud voice, and the three
        gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
        the Royal children, and everybody else.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Leave off that!" screamed the Queen, "you make me giddy." And then,
        turning to the rose tree, she went on "what <span class="u">have</span>
        you been doing here?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "May it please your Majesty," said Two very humbly, going down on one
        knee as he spoke, "we were trying—"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I see!" said the Queen, who had meantime been examining the roses, "off
        with their heads!" and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers
        remaining behind to execute the three unfortunate gardeners, who ran to
        Alice for protection.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "You sha'n't be beheaded!" said Alice, and she put them into her pocket:
        the three soldiers marched once round her, looking for them, and then
        quietly marched off after the others.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Are their heads off?" shouted the Queen.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Their heads are gone," the soldiers shouted in reply, "if it please
        your Majesty!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_74" id="CPage_74">[74]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "That's right!" shouted the Queen, "can you play croquet?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
        evidently meant for her.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Yes!" shouted Alice at the top of her voice.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Come on then!" roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
        wondering very much what would happen next.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "It's—it's a very fine day!" said a timid little voice: she was
        walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Very," said Alice, "where's the Marchioness?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Hush, hush!" said the rabbit in a low voice, "she'll hear you. The
        Queen's the Marchioness: didn't you know that?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "No, I didn't," said Alice, "what of?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Queen of Hearts," said the rabbit in a whisper, putting its mouth close
        to her ear, "and Marchioness of Mock Turtles."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "What are <span class="u">they</span>?" said Alice, but there was no
        time for the answer, for they had reached the croquet-ground, and the
        game began instantly.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in all
        her life: it was all in ridges and furrows: the croquet-balls were live
        hedgehogs, the mallets live ostriches, and the soldiers had to double
        themselves up, and stand <span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_76" id="CPage_76">[76]</a></span>on their feet and hands, to make the
        arches.
      </p>
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_075.jpg" alt="Illustration" width="600" height="323" class="img1">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        The chief difficulty which Alice found at first was to manage her
        ostrich: she got its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her
        arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its
        neck straightened out nicely, and was going to give a blow with its
        head, it <span class="u">would</span> twist itself round, and look up
        into her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
        bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going
        to begin again, it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had
        unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,
        there was generally a ridge or a furrow in her way, wherever she wanted
        to send the hedgehog to, and as the doubled-up soldiers were always
        getting up and walking off to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_77" id="CPage_77">[77]</a></span> parts of the ground, Alice
        soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
      </p>
      <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_076.jpg" width="300" height="309" alt="Illustration">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        The players all played at once without waiting for turns, and quarrelled
        all the while at the tops of their voices, and in a very few minutes the
        Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about and shouting
        "off with his head!" of "off with her head!" about once in a minute. All
        those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of
        course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of
        half an hour or so, there were no arches left, and all the players,
        except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody, and under
        sentence of execution.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice "have
        you seen the Mock Turtle?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "No," said Alice, "I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Come on then," said the Queen, "and it shall tell you its history."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to
        the company generally, "you are all pardoned."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Come, that's a good thing!" thought Alice, who had felt quite grieved
        at the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_78" id="CPage_78">[78]</a></span>
        executions which the Queen had ordered.
      </p>
      <div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_078.jpg" width="350" height="183" alt="Illustration">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        They very soon came upon a Gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the sun:
        (if you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture): "Up, lazy
        thing!" said the Queen, "and take this young lady to see the Mock
        Turtle, and to hear its history. I must go back and see after some
        executions I ordered," and she walked off, leaving Alice with the
        Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the
        whole she thought it quite as safe to stay as to go after that savage
        Queen: so she waited.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
        she was out of sight: then it chuckled. "What fun!" said the Gryphon,
        half to itself, half to Alice.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "What <span class="u">is</span> the fun?" said Alice.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Why, <span class="u">she</span>," said the Gryphon; "it's all her
        fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know: come on!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_79" id="CPage_79">[79]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Everybody says 'come on!' here," thought Alice as she walked slowly
        after the Gryphon; "I never was ordered about so before in all my life—never!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
        sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
        nearer, Alice could here it sighing as if its heart would break. She
        pitied it deeply: "what is its sorrow?" she asked the Gryphon, and the
        Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, "it's all its
        fancy, that: it hasn't got no sorrow, you know: come on!"
      </p>
      <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_079.jpg" width="300" height="385" alt="Illustration">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
        full of tears, but said nothing.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "This here young lady" said the Gryphon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_80" id="CPage_80">[80]</a></span> "wants for to know your
        history, she do."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I'll tell it," said the Mock Turtle, in a deep hollow tone, "sit down,
        and don't speak till I've finished."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        So they sat down, and no one spoke for some minutes: Alice thought to
        herself "I don't see how it can <span class="u">ever</span> finish, if
        it doesn't begin," but she waited patiently.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Once," said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, "I was a real
        Turtle."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
        occasional exclamation of "hjckrrh!" from the Gryphon, and the constant
        heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
        saying, "thank you, sir, for your interesting story," but she could not
        help thinking there <span class="u">must</span> be more to come, so she
        sat still and said nothing.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "When we were little," the Mock Turtle went on, more calmly, though
        still sobbing a little now and then, "we went to school in the sea. The
        master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?" asked Alice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_81" id="CPage_81">[81]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the Mock Turtle
        angrily, "really you are very dull!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,"
        added the Gryphon, and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
        Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth: at last the Gryphon said
        to the Mock Turtle, "get on, old fellow! Don't be all day!" and the Mock
        Turtle went on in these words:
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "You may not have lived much under the sea—" ("I haven't," said
        Alice,) "and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—"
        (Alice began to say "I once tasted—" but hastily checked herself,
        and said "no, never," instead,) "so you can have no idea what a
        delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "No, indeed," said Alice, "what sort of a thing is it?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Why," said the Gryphon, "you form into a line along the sea shore—"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Two lines!" cried the Mock Turtle, "seals, turtles, salmon, and so on—advance
        twice—"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Each with a lobster as partner!" cried the Gryphon.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Of course," the Mock Turtle said, "advance twice, set to partners—"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Change lobsters, and retire in same order—" interrupted the
        Gryphon.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Then, you know," continued the Mock Turtle, "you throw the—"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "The lobsters!" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "As far out to sea as you can—"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Swim after them!" screamed the Gryphon.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Turn a somersault in the sea!" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
        about.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Change lobsters again!" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice,
        "and then—"
      </p>
      <div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

      </div>
      <p class="font">
        "That's all," said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping its voice, and the
        two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time,
        sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "It must be a very pretty dance," said Alice timidly.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Would you like to see a little of it?" said the Mock Turtle.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Very much indeed," said Alice.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Come, let's try the first figure!" said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon,
        "we can do<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_84" id="CPage_84">[84]</a></span>
        it without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Oh! <span class="u">you</span> sing!" said the Gryphon, "I've forgotten
        the words."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then
        treading on her toes when they came too close, and waving their
        fore-paws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang, slowly and
        sadly, these words:
      </p>
      <div class="poem font">
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="i0">"Beneath the waters of the sea<br></span> <span class="i0">Are lobsters thick as thick can be—<br></span> <span class="i0">They love to dance with you and me,<br></span> <span class="i2">My own, my gentle Salmon!"<br></span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        The Gryphon joined in singing the chorus, which was:
      </p>
      <div class="poem font">
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="i0">"Salmon come up! Salmon go down!<br></span> <span class="i0">Salmon come twist your tail around!<br></span> <span class="i0">Of all the fishes <span class="u">of</span> the sea<br></span>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        "Thank you," said Alice, feeling very glad that the figure was over.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Shall we try the second figure?" said the Gryphon, "or would you prefer
        a song?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Oh, a song, please!" Alice replied, so eagerly, that the Gryphon said,
        in a rather offended tone, "hm! no accounting for tastes! Sing her 'Mock
        Turtle Soup', will you, old fellow!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
        with sobs, to sing this:
      </p>
      <div class="poem font">
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="i0">"Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,<br></span> <span class="i0">Waiting in a hot tureen!<br></span> <span class="i0">Who
          for such dainties would not stoop?<br></span> <span class="i0">Soup

          <span class="i4">Beautiful beautiful Soup!<br></span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        "Chorus again!" cried the Gryphon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_86" id="CPage_86">[86]</a></span> the Mock Turtle had just
        begun to repeat it, when a cry of "the trial's beginning!" was heard in
        the distance.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Come on!" cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, he hurried
        off, without waiting for the end of the song.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "What trial is it?" panted Alice as she ran, but the Gryphon only
        answered "come on!" and ran the faster, and more and more faintly came,
        borne on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:
      </p>
      <div class="poem font">
        <div class="stanza">

        The King and Queen were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a
        great crowd assembled around them: the Knave was in custody: and before
        the King stood the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a
        scroll of parchment in the other.
      </p>

      <p class="font">
        "Herald! read the accusation!" said the King.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        On this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
        unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="poem font">
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="i0">"The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts<br></span>

          Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts,<br></span> <span class="i2">And
          took them quite away!"<br></span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        "Now for the evidence," said the King, "and then the sentence."
      </p>
      <div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
        <img src="./ProjGut-AliceUnderground_files/image_088.jpg" width="350" height="338" alt="Illustration">
      </div>
      <p class="font">
        "No!" said the Queen, "first the sentence, and then the evidence!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Nonsense!" cried Alice, so loudly that everybody jumped, "the idea of
        having the sentence first!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Hold your tongue!" said the Queen.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "I won't!" said Alice, "you're nothing but a pack of cards! Who cares
        for you?"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
        her: she gave a little scream of fright, and tried to beat them off, and
        found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister,
        who was gently brushing away some leaves that had fluttered down from
        the trees on to her face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_89" id="CPage_89">[89]</a></span>
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Wake up! Alice dear!" said her sister, "what a nice long sleep you've
        had!"
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        "Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said Alice, and she told her sister
        all her Adventures Under Ground, as you have read them, and when she had
        finished, her sister kissed her and said "it <span class="u">was</span>
        a curious dream, dear, certainly! But now run in to your tea: it's
        getting late."
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        So Alice ran off, thinking while she ran (as well she might) what a
        wonderful dream it had been.
      </p>
      <hr style="width: 45%;">
      <p class="font">
        But her sister sat there some while longer, watching the setting sun,
        and thinking of little Alice and her Adventures, till she too began
        dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        She saw an ancient city, and a quiet river winding near it along the
        plain, and up the stream went slowly gliding a boat with a merry party
        of children on board—she could hear their voices and laughter like
        music over the water—and among them was another little Alice, who
        sat listening with bright eager eyes to a tale that was being told, and
        she listened for the words of the tale, and lo! it was the dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="CPage_90" id="CPage_90">[90]</a></span> of her
        own little sister. So the boat wound slowly along, beneath the bright
        summer-day, with its merry crew and its music of voices and laughter,
        till it passed round one of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw
        it no more.
      </p>
      <p class="font">
        Then she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how this
        same little Alice would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman:
        and how she would keep, through her riper years, the simple and loving
        heart of her childhood: and how she would gather around her other little
        children, and make <span class="u">their</span> eyes bright and eager
        with many a wonderful tale, perhaps even with these very adventures of
        the little Alice of long-ago: and how she would feel with all their
        simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
        remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

      <h2>
        "Who will Riddle me the How and the Why?"
      </h2>
      <p>
        <i>So questions one of England's sweetest singers. The "How?" has
        already been told, after a fashion, in the verses prefixed to "Alice in
        Wonderland"; and some other memories of that happy summer day are set
        down, for those who care to see them, in this little book—the germ
        that was to grow into the published volume. But the "Why?" cannot, and
        need not, be put into words. Those for whom a child's mind is a sealed
        book, and who see no divinity in a child's smile, would read such words
        in vain: while for any one that has ever loved one true child, no words
        are needed. For he will have known the awe that falls on one in the
        presence of a spirit fresh from</i> <span class="smcap">God's</span> <i>hands,
        on whom no shadow of sin, and but the outermost fringe of the shadow of
        sorrow, has yet fallen: he will have felt the bitter contrast between
        the haunting selfishness that spoils his best deeds and the life that is
        but an overflowing love—for I think a child's</i> first <i>attitude
        to the world is a simple love for all living things: and he will have
        learned that the best work a man can do is when he works for love's sake
        only, with no thought of name, or gain, or earthly reward. No deed of
        ours, I suppose, on this side the grave, is really unselfish: yet if one
        can put forth all one's powers in a task where nothing of reward is
        hoped for but a little child's whispered thanks, and the airy touch of a
        little child's pure lips, one seems to come somewhere near to this.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>There was no idea of publication in my mind when I wrote this little
        book</i>: that <i>was wholly an afterthought, pressed on me by the
        "perhaps too partial friends" who always have to bear the blame when a
        writer rushes into print: and I can truly say that no praise of theirs
        has ever given me one hundredth part of the pleasure it has been to
        think of the sick children in hospitals (where it has been a delight to
        me to send copies) forgetting, for a few bright hours, their pain and
        weariness—perhaps thinking lovingly of the unknown writer of the
        tale—perhaps even putting up a childish prayer (and oh, how much
        it needs!) for one who can but dimly hope to stand, some day, not quite
        out of sight of those pure young faces, before the great white throne.
        "I am very sure," writes a lady-visitor at a Home for Sick Children,
        "that there will be many loving earnest prayers for you on Easter
        morning from the children.</i>"
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I would like to quote further from her letters, as embodying a
        suggestion that may perhaps thus come to the notice of some one able and
        willing to carry it out.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        "<i>I want you to send me one of your Easter Greetings for a very dear
        child who is dying at our Home. She is just fading away, and 'Alice' has
        brightened some of the weary hours in her illness, and I know that
        letter would be such a delight to her—especially if you would put
        'Minnie' at the top, and she could know you had sent it for her.</i> She
        <i>knows</i> you, <i>and would so value it.... She suffers so much that
        I long for what I know would so please her." ... "Thank you very much
        for sending me the letter, and for writing Minnie's name.... I am quite
        sure that all these children will say a loving prayer for the
        'Alice-man' on Easter Day: and I am sure the letter will help the little
        ones to the real Easter joy. How I do wish that you, who have won the
        hearts and confidence of so many children, would do for them what is so
        very near my heart, and yet what no one will do, viz. write a book for
        children about</i> <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>and themselves,
        which is</i> not <i>goody, and which begins at the right end, about
        religion, to make them see what it really is. I get quite miserable very
        often over the children I come across: hardly any of them have an idea
        of</i> really <i>knowing that</i> <span class="smcap">God</span> <i>loves
        them, or of loving and confiding in Him. They will love and trust</i>
        me, <i>and be sure that I want them to be happy, and will not let them
        suffer more than is necessary: but as for going to Him in the same way,
        they would never think of it. They are dreadfully afraid of Him, if they
        think of Him at all, which they generally only do when they have been
        naughty, and they look on all connected with Him as very grave and dull:
        and, when they are full of fun and thoroughly happy, I am sure they
        unconsciously hope He is not looking. I am sure I don't wonder they
        think of Him in this way, for people</i> never <i>talk of Him in
        connection with what makes their little lives the brightest. If they are
        naughty, people put on solemn faces, and say He is very angry or
        shocked, or something which frightens them: and, for the rest, He is
        talked about only in a way that makes them think of church and having to
        be quiet. As for being taught that all Joy and all Gladness and
        Brightness is His Joy—that He is wearying for them to be happy,
        and is not hard and stern, but always doing things to make their days
        brighter, and caring for them so tenderly, and wanting them to run to
        Him with</i> all <i>their little joys and sorrows, they are not taught
        that. I do so long to make them trust Him as they trust us, to feel that
        He will 'take their part' as they do with us in their little woes, and
        to go to Him in their plays and enjoyments and not only when they say
        their prayers. I was quite grateful to one little dot, a short time ago,
        who said to his mother 'when I am in bed, I put out my hand to see if I
        can feel</i> <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> <i>and my angel. I thought
        perhaps</i> in the dark <i>they'd touch me, but they never have yet.' I
        do so want them to</i> want <i>to go to Him, and to feel how, if He is
        there, it</i> must <i>be happy.</i>"
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Let me add—for I feel I have drifted into far too serious a
        vein for a preface to a fairy-tale—the deliciously naïve
        remark of a very dear child-friend, whom I asked, after an acquaintance

        "Alice."
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span class="smcap">Dear Child</span>,
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Please to fancy, if you can, that you are reading a real letter, from
        a real friend whom you have seen, and whose voice you can seem to
        yourself to hear wishing you, as I do now with all my heart, a happy
        Easter.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Do you know that delicious dreamy feeling when one first wakes on a
        summer morning, with the twitter of birds in the air, and the fresh
        breeze coming in at the open window—when, lying lazily with eyes
        half shut, one sees as in a dream green boughs waving, or waters
        rippling in a golden light? It is a pleasure very near to sadness,
        bringing tears to one's eyes like a beautiful picture or poem. And is
        not that a Mother's gentle hand that undraws your curtains, and a
        Mother's sweet voice that summons you to rise? To rise and forget, in
        the bright sunlight, the ugly dreams that frightened you so when all was
        dark—to rise and enjoy another happy day, first kneeling to thank
        that unseen Friend, who sends you the beautiful sun</i>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Are these strange words from a writer of such tales as "Alice"? And
        is this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense? It may be so.
        Some perhaps may blame me for thus mixing together things grave and gay;
        others may smile and think it odd that any one should speak of solemn
        things at all, except in church and on a Sunday: but I think—nay,
        I am sure—that some children will read this gently and lovingly,
        and in the spirit in which I have written it.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>For I do not believe God means us thus to divide life into two halves—to
        wear a grave face on Sunday, and to think it out-of-place to even so
        much as mention Him on a week-day. Do you think He cares to see only
        kneeling figures, and to hear only tones of prayer—and that He
        does not also love to see the lambs leaping in the sunlight, and to hear
        the merry voices of the children, as they roll among the hay? Surely
        their innocent laughter is as sweet in His ears as the grandest anthem
        that ever rolled up from the "dim religious light" of some solemn
        cathedral?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And if I have written anything to add to those stores of innocent and
        healthy amusement that are laid up in books for the children I love so
        well, it is surely something I may hope to look back upon without shame
        and sorrow (as how much of life must then be recalled!) when</i> my <i>turn
        comes to walk through the valley of shadows.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>This Easter sun will rise on you, dear child, feeling your "life in
        every limb," and eager to rush out into the fresh morning air</i>—<i>and
        many an Easter-day will come and go, before it finds you feeble and
        gray-headed, creeping wearily out to bask once more in the sunlight—but
        it is good, even now, to think sometimes of that great morning when the
        "Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings.</i>"
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Surely your gladness need not be the less for the thought that you
        will one day see a brighter dawn than this—when lovelier sights
        will meet your eyes than any waving trees or rippling waters—when
        angel-hands shall undraw your curtains, and sweeter tones than ever
        loving Mother breathed shall wake you to a new and glorious day—and
        when all the sadness, and the sin, that darkened life on this little
        earth, shall be forgotten like the dreams of a night that is past!</i>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
