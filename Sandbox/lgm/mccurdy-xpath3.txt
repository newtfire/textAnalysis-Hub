1.
a. //div/count(*) is counting just the immediate child elements of each <div> element
b. //div/*/count(*) counts all the child elements within each element inside <div> and not just <div> immediate child elements
the position of the count element matters because in example a, count is placed inside the div element which makes it only count the
immediate children. In example b, count is inside "/*/" so it counts the children of all the elements inside <div>.

d. //person[occupation[@subtype = "engraver"]
e. //person[occupation[@subtype = "engraver"]][birth[@when="1787"]] = "Finden_Wm"
f. //person[occupation[@subtype = "engraver"]]/birth/@when
g. sort(//person[occupation[@subtype = "engraver"]]/birth/@when)
* i could not get the min() to work, looking at sort i can tell that the earliest year however was 1667
