Did you know that the world's largest snowflake on record measured 15 inches in diameter and 8 inches thick? It fell in Montana in 1887 and was witnessed by a ranch owner. While it's difficult to verify the accuracy of the record, it's still a fascinating piece of meteorological trivia.
Another interesting fact is that there are more possible iterations of a game of chess than there are atoms in the observable universe. In fact, the number of possible positions in a game of chess is estimated to be around 10^120, which is a mind-bogglingly large number.
Lastly, did you know that the shortest war in history was between Britain and Zanzibar in 1896 and lasted just 38 minutes? Zanzibar surrendered after their palace was bombed by the British Royal Navy, and the conflict was resolved shortly thereafter. It's an interesting example of a conflict being resolved almost as quickly as it began.
