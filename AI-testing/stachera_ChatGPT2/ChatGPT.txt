Feast like a sultan, I do
On treasures and flesh never few
But I, I would wish it all away
If I thought I'd lose you just one day
The devil and his had me down
In love with the dark side I'd found
Dabblin' all the way down
Up to my neck, soon to drown
But you changed that all for me
Lifted me up, turned me round
