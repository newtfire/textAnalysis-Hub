\cf0 \cb1 AFAB is a term used to describe individuals who were assigned a female sex at birth, but who may not identify as female or may identify as non-binary or genderqueer. This can include transgender men (people who were assigned female at birth, but identify as male), as well as non-binary people (people who do not identify as exclusively male or female).\
The term is often used in discussions around transgender and non-binary rights and experiences, as well as in medical and health care contexts. It is important to note that not everyone who is AFAB may identify as transgender or non-binary, and that an individual's gender identity may not always align with their assigned sex at birth.\
It's worth noting that the concept of AFAB is highly related to the social construct of gender and it's important to respect the self identification of individuals in terms of their gender identity.\
