\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 AMAB refers to the medical and social construct of being assigned male at birth, regardless of one's gender identity. It is often used as a way to identify individuals who were assigned male at birth but who do not identify as male, including transgender women, non-binary individuals, and others who identify outside of the gender binary.\
Being assigned male at birth can have a significant impact on an individual's life and experiences. For example, it can affect how they are treated by society and how they access healthcare. For transgender and non-binary individuals, being assigned male at birth can also mean experiencing significant social and emotional distress, known as gender dysphoria.\
It's worth noting that, like AFAB, the concept of AMAB is also highly related to the social construct of gender and it's important to respect the self identification of individuals in terms of their gender identity. And also, many people who are AMAB do not identify as transgender or non-binary, and some may identify as cisgender (whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth).\
