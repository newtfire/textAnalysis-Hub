\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a cat named Luna. Luna was a non-binary cat, which meant that they didn't identify as either male or female. Luna was a curious and adventurous cat, who loved to explore the village and the surrounding woods.\
One day, while Luna was out exploring, they stumbled upon a group of cats who were bullying a young kitten. Luna knew that they had to do something to help the kitten, so they stepped in and defended them from the bullies. The kitten was so grateful to Luna for standing up for them and the two became fast friends.\
From then on, Luna and the kitten, whose name was Star, would often go on adventures together. They explored the village, the woods, and even went on a journey to the nearby mountains. They had many exciting adventures together and always looked out for each other.\
As they grew older, Luna and Star became known throughout the village as the bravest and most loyal friends. They were respected and loved by all of the other cats and animals in the village.\
Luna and Star's friendship was a reminder to everyone that it doesn't matter if someone is male, female, or non-binary, what matters is the kind of person they are, and Luna was a true friend to all.\
The end.\
