write me a biography of Eddie Kendricks

Eddie Kendricks was an American singer and songwriter, best known as a founding member of the popular R&B vocal group, The Temptations. He was born on December 17, 1939, in Union Springs, Alabama, and began singing in church at a young age.

In the early 1960s, Kendricks joined with fellow singers Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, Otis Williams, and Elbridge Bryant to form The Primes. In 1961, the group was renamed The Temptations, and they quickly gained fame and success with their unique blend of R&B, soul, and pop music. Kendricks was known for his distinctive falsetto singing style and was one of the group's lead singers.

The Temptations released their first hit single, "The Way You Do the Things You Do," in 1964, and it reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. This was followed by a string of successful songs such as "My Girl," "Just My Imagination," and "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone." Kendricks sang lead on many of the group's biggest hits and was considered one of the most talented singers in the group.

In 1971, Kendricks left The Temptations to pursue a solo career, and he released several successful albums, including "Eddie Kendricks" and "People... Hold On," and had hit songs such as "Keep on Truckin'" and "Boogie Down." He also worked with other famous musicians such as Elton John and Paul McCartney.

Kendricks received numerous awards and accolades for his contributions to music. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Temptations in 1989.

Sadly, Kendricks passed away on October 5, 1992, at the age of 52 from lung cancer. Nevertheless, his legacy as a singer and performer continues to be celebrated to this day.
