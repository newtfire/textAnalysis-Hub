I don't think the ASCII art worked

I apologize, it seems the ASCII art didn't come out as intended. Here is an ASCII frog that may be easier to read:

   __     
   \ \    
    \ \   
     \ \  
      \ \
       \ \
       _\ \
      /   \
     |_____|
I hope this one is better! If not, please let me know and I will try again.
