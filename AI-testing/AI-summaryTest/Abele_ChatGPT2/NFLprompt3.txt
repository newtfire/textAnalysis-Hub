steelers vs buccaneers superbowl

I apologize for any confusion, The Pittsburgh Steelers and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have never met each other in the Super Bowl. The Steelers have appeared in 8 Super Bowls and won 6 of them, and the Buccaneers have appeared in 2 Super Bowls and won 1 of them. The teams have met in the regular season multiple times and also have a playoff game in 2002, but they have never met in the Super Bowl.
