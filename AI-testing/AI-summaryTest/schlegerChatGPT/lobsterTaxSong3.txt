write a song about a lobster paying taxes even though he isnt legally obligated to do so in a blues style

Verse 1:
I'm a lobster living in the sea
Got a shell as hard as can be
But I got a problem, can't ignore
Gotta pay my taxes like never before

Chorus:
Cause I'm a good citizen, don't ya see
Even though I ain't got no ID
Gotta pay my fair share, can't be late
Cause it's the right thing to do, ain't that great

Verse 2:
I ain't got no money or fame
But I got a conscience, it's my claim to fame
I ain't breaking no laws, ain't no crook
Just paying my taxes, ain't no mistook

Chorus:
Cause I'm a good citizen, don't ya see
Even though I ain't got no ID
Gotta pay my fair share, can't be late
Cause it's the right thing to do, ain't that great

Bridge:
I ain't got no voice, ain't got no vote
But I got a heart, and it's a good one to note
I ain't asking for nothing in return
Just doing my part, ain't that what we learn

Chorus:
Cause I'm a good citizen, don't ya see
Even though I ain't got no ID
Gotta pay my fair share, can't be late
Cause it's the right thing to do, ain't that great

Outro:
So when you see me in the ocean deep
Just know that I ain't breaking no rules to keep
I'm paying my taxes, it's plain to see
Cause I'm a good citizen, like you and me
