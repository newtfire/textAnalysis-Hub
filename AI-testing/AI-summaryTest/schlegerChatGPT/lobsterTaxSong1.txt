write a song about a lobster paying taxes even though he isnt legally obligated to do so in a blues style

Verse 1:
Lobster mindin' his own business in the sea
Ain't no tax man comin' around, botherin' me
But I got a conscience, and a sense of pride
So I pay my taxes, I ain't runnin' and hide

Chorus:
Cause I'm a lobster, ain't got no choice
Payin' my fair share, even though I ain't got no voice
I got the blues, but I ain't complaining
Cause I know, in the end, it's the right thing to be gaining

Verse 2:
The government ain't never done me no harm
But I know they got bills to pay, alarms to sound
So I got a few bucks, to help them out
Even though they ain't never, never helped me out

Chorus:
Cause I'm a lobster, ain't got no choice
Payin' my fair share, even though I ain't got no voice
I got the blues, but I ain't complaining
Cause I know, in the end, it's the right thing to be gaining

Verse 3:
I ain't tryna brag or boast,
But I'm just doin' what I believe is the most
I ain't got no lawyers or fancy friends
But I know, in my heart, this is where my money ends

Outro:
Cause I'm a lobster, ain't got no choice
Payin' my fair share, even though I ain't got no voice
I got the blues, but I ain't complaining
Cause I know, in the end, it's the right thing to be gaining
