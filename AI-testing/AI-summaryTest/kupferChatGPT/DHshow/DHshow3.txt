Write a premise for a show about a digital humanities college class.

"Code, Culture, and Critique" is a show that follows a group of undergraduate students as they embark on a journey to explore the intersection of technology and the humanities in a college course titled Digital Humanities. The class is taught by a brilliant and unorthodox professor who challenges the students to think beyond the boundaries of their respective majors, and to question the impact of technology on society, culture and art. Throughout the semester, students are introduced to a range of digital tools and methodologies and are tasked with creating their own digital projects that reflect their personal interests and passions. The class is a melting pot of ideas, cultures, and perspectives, as students come from different backgrounds and majors. They navigate the challenges of working in a multidisciplinary environment, and learn to embrace the possibilities of technology while also being critical of its consequences.
