Write a premise for a comedy show about a digital humanities college class.
("comedy" was added to the prompt.)

"Human Error" is a comedy show that follows the comedic misadventures of a group of students in a Digital Humanities class at a liberal arts college. The class is taught by a well-meaning but hapless professor who is more interested in his own research than actually teaching. The students are a motley crew of misfits, including a slacker, an overachiever, and a conspiracy theorist. They all have different reasons for being in the class, but they all quickly realize that they have no idea what they're getting into. Each episode follows the class as they try to make sense of the bizarre assignments and projects given to them by the professor, with their attempts at understanding the material often leading to hilarious misunderstandings and mishaps. Along the way, the students learn valuable lessons about the intersection of technology and the humanities, but also about themselves and the importance of friendship and teamwork.
