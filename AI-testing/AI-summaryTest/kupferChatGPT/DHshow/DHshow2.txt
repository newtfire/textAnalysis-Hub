Write a premise for a show about a digital humanities college class.

In "Digital Renaissance," a prestigious liberal arts college unveils a new interdisciplinary program, the Digital Humanities. The show follows a group of students from different majors as they come together in a dynamic class that explores the intersection of technology and the humanities. From analyzing historical texts using machine learning, to creating digital art installations, the students are pushed to think critically about the role of technology in shaping our understanding of the past, present and future. The class is led by a charismatic professor who encourages them to question the status quo and challenge their own assumptions. As the semester unfolds, the students form close bonds as they work on ambitious projects that blur the lines between the digital and the real world.
