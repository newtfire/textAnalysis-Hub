Write a premise for a show about a digital humanities college class.

A group of diverse college students are brought together in a digital humanities class where they learn about the intersection of technology and the humanities. They explore how technology is changing the way we study and preserve human culture, and how it can be used to create new forms of expression. As the class progresses, the students work on group projects that combine their newfound knowledge with their own interests and passions, leading to unexpected discoveries and creative solutions. Along the way, they navigate the challenges of working with technology and grapple with ethical questions about its role in society.
