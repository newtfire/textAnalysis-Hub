The novel was first published in 1818 and it is considered one of the most iconic and enduring works of science fiction. Dr. Victor Frankenstein is the main character of the novel, a scientist who creates a monster using the latest scientific techniques and discoveries of the time.

The phrase "I'm something of a scientist myself" is often used to reflect Dr. Frankenstein's pride in his scientific knowledge and abilities, but it also reflects his hubris and his underestimation of the consequences of his actions.
