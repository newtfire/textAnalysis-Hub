Tell a short story about the girl in the white dress.

Once there was a young girl named Lily who lived in a small village by the coast. She had always been fascinated by the ocean and spent most of her days wandering along the sandy beach, collecting shells and watching the waves roll in. She had a special love for one particular shell that she had found on the beach, it was small, white, and had a delicate pink spiral. She cherished it so much that she decided to sew it onto her favorite dress, a white sundress made of lightweight cotton, which she always wore when she went to the beach.

One day, while she was out exploring the coast, a fierce storm rolled in. The winds were so strong that they knocked Lily off her feet and sent her tumbling down the beach. She was tossed and turned by the waves, and soon she was being pulled out to sea. She thought she would surely drown, but just as she was about to give up, she saw a beautiful dolphin jump out of the water, it swam over to her and lifted her head above water, helped her to stay afloat. Lily was amazed, she had never seen a dolphin that close before, and it seemed as if it was trying to tell her something. She realized that the dolphin was trying to take her to safety, following it's lead, she was able to make her way to the shore.

Once she was back on the beach, she collapsed on the sand, exhausted but safe. When she looked down at her dress, she saw that the shell had been lost during her ordeal, but the dress was still there, and it was not damaged in any way. From that day on, she always wore the dress as a reminder of her experience, the determination, and the kindness of the dolphin. The villagers came to associate the dress with her rescue and started to view it as a symbol of good luck. And she continued to explore the coast, always keeping an eye out for her dolphin friend.
