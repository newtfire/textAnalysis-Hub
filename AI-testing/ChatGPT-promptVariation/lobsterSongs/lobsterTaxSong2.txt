write a song about a lobster paying taxes even though he isnt legally obligated to do so in a blues style

Verse 1:
Well, I'm a lobster, living in the sea
I ain't got no bills, no taxes to pay
But I got a conscience, and it's gnawing at me
So I'm gonna pay my fair share, come tax day

Chorus:
I might not have to, but I want to
Pay my taxes, like a good citizen do
I might be a lobster, but that don't mean
I ain't got no sense of what's right or what's wrong

Verse 2:
Now, I ain't got no vote, ain't got no say
In how this government runs, or what it does
But I know I gotta do my part
To make sure this society keeps on humming

Chorus:
I might not have to, but I want to
Pay my taxes, like a good citizen do
I might be a lobster, but that don't mean
I ain't got no sense of what's right or what's wrong

Bridge:
Some folks say, "Why bother? It's not like you got a choice"
But I say, "I got a voice, and it's got a choice"
I might not be human, but that don't mean
I ain't got no sense of what's right or what's wrong

Outro:
So I'm gonna pay my taxes, come what may
I might be a lobster, but I'm gonna do it my way
I might not have to, but I want to
Pay my taxes, like a good citizen do.
