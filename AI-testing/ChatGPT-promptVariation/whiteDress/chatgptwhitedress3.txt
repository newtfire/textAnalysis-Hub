Tell a short story about the girl in the white dress.

Once upon a time, there was a girl named Rose who lived in a small town by the sea. She was known for her beauty and her long, flowing white dress that she always wore. It was a gift from her mother, who had passed away when Rose was just a young girl. The dress was made of the finest silk and it shimmered in the sunlight like the sea itself. Rose treasured the dress and took great care to keep it clean and well-maintained.

One day, Rose decided to take a walk along the beach. She put on her white dress, grabbed her straw hat and set out for the sand. As she walked, she noticed a group of children playing in the water. They were having so much fun, but Rose couldn't help but notice that they were dirty and their clothes were worn. She felt moved by their situation and her heart ached for them. Without hesitation, she took off her dress and gave it to the children, knowing they would put it to better use than she ever could.

The children were overjoyed, they had never seen a dress so beautiful and they were amazed that someone would give it away like that. They thanked Rose and ran off to play, leaving Rose standing in her slip and her straw hat. But Rose didn't feel bad, on the contrary, she felt happy and content. She realized that true beauty comes not from possessions but from the kindness in one's heart. She walked home, feeling lighter and happier than she ever had before.

Word of her kindness spread quickly, and the people of the town came to love and admire her. Rose continued to do good deeds for the community, and she became known as the "Angel in the White Dress". From that day on, she never needed another white dress, her kindness and her deeds were her true adornment.
