Round 2 

Me: give me a long story in the style of Edgar Allen Poe that features Robert Downey Jr. celebrating his birthday in the 1900s with also featuring Rick Sanchez

ChatGPT:Once upon a time, in the year 1900, Robert Downey Jr. was celebrating his birthday in a grand mansion nestled in the heart of the city. The air was thick with the sweet scent of roses, and the moon shone bright in the sky, casting a ghostly glow upon the festivities.

Robert, dressed in a black suit and top hat, stood in the center of the ballroom, surrounded by his closest friends and family. He raised a glass of champagne, and the room erupted into cheers.

But something was amiss. A dark and foreboding feeling hung over the party, as if something sinister was lurking just out of sight.

As the night went on, strange occurrences began to happen. Guests reported feeling a chill run down their spine, and objects in the room seemed to move on their own. Some even claimed to see ghostly apparitions lurking in the shadows.

Robert, being the curious and adventurous soul that he was, decided to investigate. He made his way to the basement of the mansion, where he discovered a secret room. Inside, he found Rick Sanchez, a brilliant scientist and inventor, who had been experimenting with time travel.

Rick explained that he had accidentally opened a portal to the past, and the ghostly entities were spirits from another time. But before Robert could fully grasp the situation, the portal suddenly closed, trapping them both in the past.

They found themselves in the year 1849, in the very same mansion, but it was in a state of disrepair and abandon. They soon realized that they were trapped in a time loop, and the only way to escape was to solve the mystery of the haunted mansion.

They searched the mansion and discovered that the spirits were the ghosts of the previous owners, who had been murdered by a vengeful servant. The only way to break the curse and escape the time loop was to solve the murder and bring the killer to justice.

With the help of clues left behind by the spirits, Robert and Rick finally unmasked the killer and put the spirits to rest. The portal opened once more, and they were able to return to the present.

As they emerged from the basement, the guests of the party were amazed to see them reappear, unharmed and unscathed. Robert and Rick told their incredible tale, and the partygoers were in awe.

From that day on, Robert and Rick were known as the masters of the supernatural, and their friendship was stronger than ever. And as for the haunted mansion, it was never troubled by spirits again.

The end.
