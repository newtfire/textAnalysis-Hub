FATHER: 	(OFF) Snooks....Snooks, where are you?

SNOOKS: 	(CALLS) I'm right here, Daddy.

FATHER: 	(COMING IN) Snooks, what are you doing by the radio?

SNOOKS: 	I'm listening to the Camel Screen Guild show - and you

		know what?

FATHER: 	What?

SMITH:		How mild can a cigarette be?

BARCLAY:	Smoke CAMELS -- and see!

SMITH:		Yes, prove for yourself how mild <u>CAMELS</u> are.

BARCLAY:	In a recent coast-to-coast test of hundreds of men and

		women who smoked CAMELS, and only Camels for thirty

		days, noted throat specialists reported <u>not one single</u>

		<u>case of throat irritation due to smoking CAMELS!</u>

FATHER: 	All right now, Snooks, you've heard the commercial. You've

		been having a busy Christmas week and it's time you went

		to bed.
 
SNOOKS: 	Why?

FATHER: 	Well, I should think you'd want to go to bed and rest

		up for tomorrow. Then you can play with your now toys

		again all day.

SNOOKS: 	Are you goin' to bed and rest up?

FATHER: 	No, why?

SNOOKS: 	Well, you played with 'em more than I did.

FATHER: 	Don't be so selfish. Will you go to bed if I sing you
		a song?

SNOOKS: 	A lullaby?

FATHER: 	Uh-huh.

SNOOKS: 	Rock-a-bye-baby?

FATHER: 	Uh-huh?

SNOOKS: 	I'd rather stay here.

FATHER: 	Well, you can't sit by the radio all night.

SNOOKS: 	But they're going to tell my favorite story, Pistachio.
 
FATHER: 	Pistachio? You mean Pinocchio. Pistachio is a nut.
 
SNOOKS: 	No, he ain't, Daddy. He's a little boy.
 
FATHER: 	The boy's name's Pinocchio. I know the story very well.

SNOOKS: 	So do I. His father carved him out of wood.

FATHER: 	Exactly. Do you know his father's name?

SNOOKS: 	Uh, huh.

FATHER: 	What is it?

[5]

SNOOKS: 	Edgar Bergen.

FATHER: 	Just as I thought. You're bluffing. When I was your age

		I knew the story of Pinocchio backwards.

SNOOKS: 	Did you?

FATHER: 	Yes. Now will you go to sleep if I tell it to you?

SNOOKS: 	Backwards?

FATHER: 	No, forwards!

SNOOKS: 	All right, Daddy. Tell me the story.                                             

FATHER: 	Once upon a time, long long ago, there was a kind old man

		named Geppetto. He was a toymaker and he lived all alone --

		no one to talk to but his cat and his goldfish.                                   

SNOOKS: 	Did the cat really talk?

FATHER: 	Certainly. It said "meeoow".

SNOOKS: 	What did the goldfish say?

FATHER: 	It -- er -- uh - don't be silly. Goldfish don't talk.

		They open their mouths and they never say anything.

SNOOKS: 	You mean like you do when Mummy's around?

FATHER: 	When Mummy's around I'm not a goldfish.

SNOOKS: 	What are you?

DADDY: 		I'm a dead pigeon!

SNOOKS: 	Poor Daddy. Tell me more about Pistachio.

<u>ORCH:		MUSIC SNEAKS IN NARRATION THEME SOFTLY    </u>

[6]

FATHER: 	Pinocchio...Well, one cold winter night, just after

		Christmas, when most people were enjoying good cheer

		and fellowship with their families, old Geppetto was in

		his cottage all alone...And he was feeling a bit sad,

		because he didn't have any family at all. Just his cat

		and his goldfish -- and a little wooden puppet he had

		just finished carving...and he turned to Figaro -- that

		was the name of his cat, you see -- and he said --

		(<u>MUSIC CUTS</u>)

GEPPETTO:	Figaro, he is the nicest puppet I have ever seen.

		I think I will call him Pinocchio. (<u>CAT MEOWS</u>) Oh, you

		like that name, eh? (<u>CAT MEOWS</u>) He's such a cute

		little fellow. He almost looks alive. (WISTFUL) Figaro,

		wouldn't it be nice if he were real? (<u>CAT MEOWS LOUDER</u>)

		What is it, Figaro? What do you want? (<u>CAT MEOWS</u>) Oh,

		the window is open. You want me to close it, eh? Very

		well, I'll -- (<u>STOPS SHORT</u>) Figaro - look. Up there!

		The Wishing Star! (<u>MUSIC SNEAKS IN VERY SOFTLY</u>) Star

		light, star bright O First star I see tonight - I wish

		I may, I wish I might -- Have the wish I make tonight...

		(<u>CAT MEOWS</u>) Figaro, you know what I wished? I wished

		that my little Pinocchio might be a real boy.

<u>MUSIC:		(UP FULL...AND OUT)</u>

DADDY: 		Well, Snooks, how do you like the story so far?

SNOOKS: 	I like it. What happened next?

[7]

DADDY: 		Old Geppetto went to sleep.

SNOOKS: 	Why?

DADDY: 		That's the story. He just went to sleep. That's all.

SNOOKS: 	That's all?

DADDY: 		Yes.

SNOOKS: 	That's a very short story.

DADDY: 		Don't be silly. Geppetto went to sleep and late that

		night, a beautiful blue light shone in through the

		window. And it blazed and it glowed, and in the middle
 
		of it stood -- the Blue Fairy. (<u>MUSIC HITS FAINT</u>
 
		<u>SHIMMERING CHORD</u>) And she touched Pinocchio with her
 
		golden wand and said - (<u>MUSIC: CUTS</u>)

FAIRY:		Little puppet made of pine - awake, the gift of life is

		thine. (<u>LIGHT RATTLE OF WOOD</u>)

PINOCCHIO:	Golly - I can move...And I can talk.

FAIRY:		Yes, Pinocchio, I have given you life.

PINOCCHIO:	Why?

FAIRY:		Because the good Geppetto brought so much happiness

		to others with his toys - and tonight he wished for a

		real boy.

PINOCCHIO:	Am I a real boy?

FAIRY:		Not yet, Pinocchio...To make Geppetto's wish come true

		will be entirely up to you...

PINOCCHIO:	Up to me...

[8]

FAIRY: 		Yes...Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish --

		and someday you will be a real boy.

PINOCCHIO:	(DELIGHTED) Oh! A real boy!

FAIRY:		It will not be easy. You must learn to choose between

		right and wrong.

PINOCCHIO:	Right and wrong? How will I know?

FAIRY:		Your conscience will tell you.

PINOCCHIO:	Conscience? Where will I find one?

JIMINY:		Hello! What about me?

PINOCCHIO:	(STARTLED) What's <u>that</u>?

FAIRY:		Why it's a cricket!

JIMINY:		Jiminy Cricket's the name, yes siree - and I'm little

		as anyone's conscience can be.

FAIRY:		I think you would be just the one...Kneel, Sir Jiminy

		Cricket. I dub thee Pinocchio's conscience.

JIMINY:		Oh, gosh....

FAIRY:		Now, Pinocchio, remember. Be a good boy - and always

		let your conscience be your guide. (<u>MUSIC HITS FAINT</u>

		<u>SHIMMERING CHORD</u>)

PINOCCHIO:	Look - she's gone.

JIMINY:		That's right, Pinoke. And listen to me -- you and I

		better have a little friendly talk.

PINOCCHIO:	Why?

JIMINY:		Well, you want to be a real boy, don't you?

		A lallapalooza?

[9]

PINOCCHIO:	Uh-huh.

JIMINY:		That's fine. But the world is cram full of lovely

		temptations.

PINOCCHIO:	Temptations?

JIMINY:		Yep - temptations. They're the wrong things that seem

		right at the time, but - uh - even though the right

		things may seem wrong some times - uh - sometimes the

		wrong things - uh - may be right - at the wrong time - 

		uh - or vise versa...you follow me?

PINOCCHIO:	(PAUSE) Uh-uh...But I'm going to do right.

JIMINY:		Atta boy, Pinoke. And I'm gonna help you...and any time

		you need me, just whistle. Like this -- (<u>WHISTLES TWO</u>

		<u>OR THREE NOTES</u>)

PINOCCHIO:	Like this? (<u>TRIES TO WHISTLE, BUT CAN'T</u>)

JIMINY:		No, son. Like -- (<u>AS MUSIC HITS CHORD</u>) Well, listen.

SNOOKS: 	Daddy.

DADDY:		What?

SNOOKS: 	Didn't all that noise wake up Pinocchio's father?

DADDY:		Yes of course.

SNOOKS: 	Did the noise wake up Pinocchio?

DADDY:		He wasn't asleep.

SNOOKS: 	Don't little wooden dummies sleep?

DADDY:		Yes. They sleep like logs. Ha-ha. How's that?

SNOOKS: 	Ha-ha--terrible! What happened next?

DADDY:		Well, Geppetto was delighted to find that his little

		wooden boy could walk and talk.

SNOOKS: 	He liked him, huh?

DADDY:		Yes, and the next morning he sent him off to <u>school</u>.

SNOOKS: 	I thought you said he liked him!

DADDY:		He did. But he wanted Pinocchio to be like other little

		children. So that morning Pinocchio got up and ran as

		fast as he could to the school house.

SNOOKS: 	Imagine that?

DADDY:		Now, why aren't you so anxious to go to school as

		Pinocchio is?

SNOOKS: 	'Cause I'm no dummy!

DADDY:		Hmmm! Well, anyhow, on the way to school Pinocchio ran

		into a sly old wolf.

SNOOKS: 	A wolf?

DADDY:		Yes, and do you know what his name was?

[11]

SNOOKS: 	Uncle Louie!

DADDY:		No, this wolf was named Honest John, and he was standing

		on the street, reading a big advertising billboard that

		said ---

HONEST J:	(READING) "Tonight, in the big tent - the Great

		Stromboli and his Puppet Show"! .. Well, well - so

		Stromboli is in town! (CHUCKLES) The old rascal - I

		certainly fooled, him once, all right! (LAUGHING) That

		time I tied strings on a cat - and Stromboli bought her

		for a puppet! (HE ROARS WITH LAUGHTER DURING WHICH

		PINOCCHIO FADES IN SINGING "GIVE A LITTLE WHISTLE")

		(STILL LAUGHING) Good morning, my little friend.

PINOCCHIO:	(BRIGHTLY) Good morning. 

HONEST J:	And where are you going this fine sunny day?

PINOCCHIO:	I'm going to school - just like a real boy!
 
		(FADES, SINGING "GIVE A LITTLE WHISTLE")

HONEST J:	(THROUGH PINOCCHIO'S FADE..CHUCKLES) Well that's fine.

		Just imagine - a little wooden boy. Now who'd ever

		believe that -- (BIG TAKE) <u>A wooden boy</u>! ..A puppet

		without strings!...Why, Stromboli would give a fortune

		for him! He'd -- (SHOUTS) Hey there - wait! (FADING)

		Wait for me, little boy!

<u>MUSIC:		(ACCENT CHORD..AND FADE OUT INTO)</u>

HONEST J:	(OVER-FRIENDLY) So you're going to school, my little man.

		Going to be a scholar, eh?

[12]

PINOCCHIO:	Yes, I'm going to learn to be brave, truthful and

		unselfish - so I can be a real boy some day.

HONEST J:	Indeed, indeed !

PINOCCHIO:	I must be going now. I'm late.

HONEST J:	Just a minute, young fellow, just a minute. Haven't

		you heard of the easy road to success?

PINOCCHIO:	The easy road?

HONEST J:	I'm speaking, my boy - <u>of the theatre</u>!

PINOCCHIO:	The theatre?

HONEST J:	Bright lights - music - applause - your name up in

		lights. Uh - what is your name?

PINOCCHIO:	Pinocchio.

HONEST J:	Why, I can see it in letters six feet high!

PINOCCHIO:	Six feet high!

FATHER: 	Well, Snooks, how do you like that way I'm telling this

SNOOKS: 	I'd rather listen to the Screen Guild Show.

FATHER: 	Oh you would. What have they got that I haven't got?

SNOOKS: 	Camels!

FATHER: 	Well, <u>I've</u> got some Camels. I've got a package

		right on my desk.

SNOOKS: 	Not any more you haven't!

FATHER: 	(AGHAST) Snooks! You -- you - didn't --- ?

SNOOKS: 	Uh-huh .... (PAUSE) I fed 'em to the goldfish this

<u>COMMERCIAL</u>

SMITH:		And while Daddy counts ten, we'll have time to talk

		about Camel mildness. . . . .How <u>mild</u> can a cigarette be?

BARCLAY:	Smoke Camels and <u>see</u> just how mild a cigarette can <u>be</u>!

SMITH:		Here's what noted throat specialists reported in a

		recent coast-to-coast smoking test.

BARCLAY:	In this test, hundreds of men and women smoked Camels,

		and only Camels, for thirty days....an average of one to

		two packs a day. After careful, weekly examinations of

		these smokers' throats...two thousand, four hundred and

		seventy examinations in all...the throat specialists

		reported <u>not one single case of throat irritation due to</u>

		<u>smoking Camels! </u>

SMITH:		Test Camel mildness for yourself. Yes, try rich, full-

		flavored Camels. If, at any time, you are not convinced

		that Camels are the mildest cigarette you ever smoked,

		return the package with the unused, cigarettes to the

		makers of Camels, and you will receive its full purchase

		price, plus postage.

BARCLAY:	Yes, try Camels. And remember...Camels by the carton

		are the best buy!

SMITH:		Camel cigarettes now present Act II of [Walt Disney's] "Pinocchio".

		starring Fanny Brice and Hanley Stafford, with Jeffrey

		Silver as Pinocchio, Hans Conried as Honest John, [Janet Wald] and

		Arthur Q. Bryan as Jiminy Cricket.

[MUSIC:		(THEME)]

[16]

SNOOKS: 	Did Pinocchio like being an actor, Daddy?

FATHER: 	No. He didn't like it at all.

SNOOKS: 	Why?

FATHER: 	Because Stromboli soon discovered that he could make

		lot of money with Pinocchio, so he locked the little boy

		in a cage.

SNOOKS: 	(WHIMPERS) He locked him in a cage?

FATHER: 	Yes.

SNOOKS: 	(CRIES)

FATHER: 	What's the matter with you?

SNOOKS: 	Poor little Pinocchio -- locked up in a dirty old cage.

FATHER: 	Well, I can't help it.

SNOOKS: 	Take him out of the cage!

FATHER: 	Now, look, Snooks. He's in this cage because that's the

		way the story goes. If he wasn't in the cage, there

		wouldn't be any story, and you'd be up in bed. Asleep.

SNOOKS: 	(PAUSE) Daddy!

FATHER: 	What?

SNOOKS: 	I'm glad he's in a cage!

[17]

FATHER: 	Fine! Now may I continue?

SNOOKS: 	Please do.

FATHER: 	Thank you.

		Cricket found him in the cage .. And he called to the

		Blue Fairy -- and she come down, and decided to give

		Pinocchio one more chance .. So she unlocked the cage,

		and Pinocchio and Jiminy went hurrying home. And as they

		were going along the street --

<u>MUSIC:		CUTS</u>

PINOCCHIO:	No sir! Nothing can stop me now, Jiminy. I'll make good

		this time.

JIMINY:		You'd better!

PINOCCHIO:	I will! I'm going to school!

JIMINY:		That's the stuff, Pinoke!

PINOCCHIO:	I'll be <u>smart</u>, too! I'd rather be smart than be an actor!

HONEST J: 	(COMING IN) Well, well, well - if it isn't my little

JIMINY:		(WORRIED) Oh-oh -- It's Honest John.

HONEST J:	Tell me, Pinocchio -- how do you like the Great Stromboli?

PINOCCHIO:	Oh, he was awful! He locked me in a cage!

HONEST J:	He did?

PINOCCHIO:	And he wouldn't feed me -- and he made me sing all night,

PINOCCHIO:	Pleasure Island?

HONEST J:	That happy land of carefree boys! No school, no work -

SNOOKS: 	Would you feel better if I stopped asking questions?

DADDY:		Yes.

SNOOKS: 	(PAUSE) Poor little daddy.

DADDY:		Now, sit back and listen! Jiminy and Pinocchio

		went looking for Geppetto and where do you

		they found him?

SNOOKS: 	Where?

DADDY:		Inside a whale.

SNOOKS: 	(OFF HAND) Oh.

DADDY:		Oh? Is that all you have to say? He was actually

		inside a great big whale.

SNOOKS: 	(UNIMPRESSED) That's what you said.

DADDY:		But, isn't that remarkable? A man! A  full grown man!

		Isn't that an awful lot for a whale to swallow?

SNOOKS: 	Isn't it an awful lot for me to swallow?

DADDY:		Well, it happens to be true. What's more Jiminy

		and Pinocchio went down to the bottom of the sea

		and joined Geppetto inside the whale.

SNOOKS: 	Imagine that.

[21]

DADDY:		But then the whale clamped his teeth and they couldn't

		come out.

SNOOKS: 	The teeth couldn't come out?

DADDY:		No. Pinocchio, Jiminy and Geppetto couldn't come out.

SNOOKS: 	But you said --

DADDY:		Never mind what I said. You said the whale's teeth

		came out, which is false.

SNOOKS: 	Were they false teeth?

DADDY:		Look, let's get out of the whale's mouth.

SNOOKS: 	How we gonna do it?

DADDY:		Well, Pinocchio had an idea. He figured a way to make

		the whale blow them out.

SNOOKS: 	Did he make the whale cough?

DADDY:		Well, you're pretty close I admit. But how would you 

		go about making a whale cough?

SNOOKS: 	Get his feet wet?

DADDY:		Whales don't have feet. What Pinocchio did was build a

		fire in the whale's stomach.

SNOOKS: 	How did that make the whale blow them out?

DADDY:		I guess you've never seen a whale sneeze?

SNOOKS: 	A whale's knees?

DADDY:		Yes.

SNOOKS: 	But you said they didn't have legs!

[22]

DADDY:		Stop acting cute! The whale sneezed. He

		sneezed, do you understand?....Achoo! (PAUSE)

		Well, say something!

SNOOKS: 	Gesundheit!

DADDY:		Snooks, I think I'm going to put you to bed.

SNOOKS: 	No, I'll be good. Tell me the rest of the story.

DADDY:		Very well. The whale sneezed them out and old Geppetto

		nearly drowned. But Pinocchio came to his aid, and

		towed him in to shore. In doing so, the little wooden

		boy gave up his own life to save his father's!

SNOOKS: 	Poor Pistachio!

DADDY:		Pinocchio!

<u>MUSIC:		SNEAKS IN "NARRATION THEME" .. SOFTLY</u>

DADDY:		And when the old man came to, he picked Pinocchio

		out of the water where he was lying, and carried

		him home, and put him on the bed. And then he

		kneeled by the bed and cried and cried....

GEPPETTO:	(SOBBING) Pinocchio....Oh, my boy..my brave little

		boy....(CONTINUES SOBBING SOFTLY)

DADDY:		And as he knelt there, the beautiful blue light came 

		in through the window again....It was the Blue Fairy

		herself...and she touched Pinocchio with her golden

		wand, and she said -- (<u>MUSIC CUTS</u>)

[23]

FAIRY:		(SOFTLY) Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish,

		and some day you will be a real boy....Awake, Pinocchio,

		awake!

GEPPETTO:	(SOBBING) My poor boy....my poor boy.

PINOCCHIO:	Father - what are you crying for?

GEPPETTO:	Because you're dead, Pinocchio.

PINOCCHIO:	No, I'm not.

GEPPETTO:	Yes you are. Now lie down --

PINOCCHIO:	But, Father. I'm alive - see! And I'm - I -- I'm a

		real boy! (<u>MUSIC SNEAKS INTRODUCTION .. VERY SOFT</u>)

GEPPETTO:	(INCREDULOUS) You are!.....You're alive! And you <u>are</u>

		a real boy! (SOFTLY, JOYOUSLY) Oh, Pinocchio - - 

		Pinocchio - now all my wishes have come true!

		(CHORUS .. INTO SONG)

<u>MUSIC:		"WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR" .. CHORUS</u>

		(APPLAUSE)

DADDY:		And that's the end of the story, Snooks. That's the

		story of Pinocchio....and now it's time you went to

		sleep....Come on, Snooks to sleep....(A PAUSE)

		<u>Snooks</u>! Snooks. I absolutely insist that you go

		to sleep.

SNOOKS: 	But Daddy, I <u>was</u> asleep! You just woke me up! (AND SHE

		BAWLS, AS:)

<u>MUSIC: 		IN FULL FOR CURTAIN</u>

		(APPLAUSE)

COMMERCIAL:

BARCLAY:	Our stars Fanny Brice and Hanley Stafford will return

		to the microphone in just a moment.

SMITH:		How mild can a cigarette <u>be</u>?

BARCLAY:	Try Camels. Test for yourself what noted throat

		specialists reported about Camel mildness.

SMITH:		In a recent coast-to-coast smoking test, hundreds of

		men and women smoked Camels, and only Camels, for

		thirty days....an average of one to two packs a day.

		Noted throat specialists made weekly examinations of

		these smokers' throats. And they reported <u>not one</u>

		<u>single case of throat irritation due to smoking</u>

		<u>Camels</u>!

BARCLAY:	Try Camels. If at any time, you are not convinced

		that Camels are the mildest cigarette you ever

		smoked, return the package with the unused cigarettes

		to the makers of Camels, and you'll receive its

		full purchase price, plus postage.

SMITH:		Yes, try Camels in your "T-Zone"...T for Taste and

		T for Throat. See how Camel's choice tobaccos,

		properly aged and expertly blended, bring you rich,

		full flavor as well as mildness....See if Camels

		don't suit your "T-Zone" to a T!

<u>MUSIC:		(TAG)</u>

[25]

SNOOKS: 	Daddy. . .

DADDY:		Oh, no.... Snooks, you mean you haven't fallen asleep

		<u>yet</u>?

SNOOKS: 	How <u>could</u> I - with such a short commercial?.... Besides

		I want to hear that other part. You know -- where they

		always say that the Screen Guild show supports the Motion

		Picture Relief Fund and its Country House and Hospital.

DADDY:		All right, consider it said! Now run along to sleep!

SNOOKS: 	But what about all those nice people, Daddy?

DADDY:		<u>What</u> people ?

SNOOKS: 	The makers of Camel Cigarettes. <u>Do</u> <u>you</u> <u>know</u> that every

		week they send free smokes to service men's hospitals all

		over the country --

DADDY:		Yes, as a matter of fact, I <u>do</u> know. And this week, among

		other hospitals free Camels are being sent to: Veterans's

		Hospital, Van Nuys, California.....U.S. Naval Hospital,

		Newport, Rhode Island...and U.S. Marine Hospital,

		Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. That makes a total of more than

		one hundred and eighty million cigarettes that the Camel

		People have sent to service men, service women, and

		veterans!

		And Snooks, that is positively the last word tonight:

SNOOKS: 	(CUTELY) Oh no it isn't.....

DADDY:		(APOPLECTIC) What else?!!!!!

SNOOKS: 	(LAUGHING) Happy New Year!

DADDY:		Snooks, for two cents I'd -- Happy New Year, everybody,

		Happy New Year! Happy New Year!
