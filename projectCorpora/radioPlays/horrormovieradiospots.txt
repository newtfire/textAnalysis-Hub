ANNOUNCER: (CALM AND GRIM) "Schizoid" is a motion picture of such biting, 
gnawing terror, it claws at your brain. 

"Schizoid" -- so mind-boggling the following warning has been posted in the 
theater: "Schizoid" is not recommended viewing for persons with schizophrenic 
tendencies. 

"Schizoid": the loss of reality; a personality split in two.

TWO WOMEN: (ONE VERY CALM; THE OTHER SHOUTING, HEAVILY ECHOED, AND TERRIFIED) 
It's terrifying, doctor. This long corridor -- and then -- thousands of bats 
-- attacking me.

SOUND: CHATTERING FLUTTERING BATS

TWO WOMEN: I run into a room. A woman is there. And I just plunge a dagger 
into her heart.

WOMAN: (HEAVY ECHO, BLOODCURDLING SCREAM)

TWO WOMEN: Tell me it's a nightmare. Please. Let it be a nightmare.

ANNOUNCER: Was it a dream? Or was it real? Don't miss "Schizoid," an American-
International Pictures release, in color, rated R. "Schizoid" -- it might even 
drive you out of your mind.

MUSIC: UP AND FADES OUT
