	pleasure by the manufacturers of Lucky Strike Cigarettes. The 

	Lucky Strike Dance Orchestra will be heard in the tunes that

	<u>MR. ROLFE</u>: Here's a real dancing combination - a good one from 

	           George White's Scandals, <u>Pickin' Cotton</u> and another 

	           old friend, <u>Bambalina</u>.

	<u>MR. ROLFE</u>: Here's a chance for your feet to join the many thou-

	           sands who have danced to the enticing strains of "The 

	           Parade of the Wooden Soldiers" by the Lucky Strike 

	           Orchestra.

	<u>ANNOUNCER</u>:  

	      "Douglas Fairbanks, America's motion picture favorite, 

	will soon appear in his new production of "The Iron Mask". This is 

	a sequel to "The Three Musketeers" with Mr. Fairbanks again 

	playing the part of D'Artagnan. The characters, however, are more 

	romantic and adventurous and Mr. Fairbanks considers the picture 

	as a whole to be faster moving than any story he has ever brought 

	to the screen. The manufacturers of Lucky Strikes have requested 

	me to read what Douglas Fairbanks has to say regarding the Lucky 

	Strike Cigarette. Mr. Fairbanks says - "I get more kick from the 

	Lucky Strike flavor than from any other cigarette. They are 

	easier on my throat and wind. That's why I smoke nothing but 

	Luckies. Toasting really means a lot to me. My own experience has 

	proven that toasting not only takes out the bad things but 

	doubles the flavor." 

	<u>LOCAL ANNOUNCEMENT</u>:  

	<u>MR. ROLFE</u>: That is the high opinion Douglas Fairbanks has of  

	           Lucky Strike cigarettes. The Lucky Strike Dance  

	           Orchestra continues with Crazy Rhythm, a musical 

	           impediment of speech, together with Mitzi's favorite 

	           from Pom-Pom, <u>Oh Evelyn' Stop Your Develin'</u>.

6.(<u>CRAZY RHYTHM - ORCHESTRA</u>)  

7.(<u>OH EVELYN' STOP YOUR DEVELIN' - ORCHESTRA</u>)  

	<u>MR. ROLFE</u>: A waltz dedicated to all lovers, <u>The Sweetheart of</u> 

	           <u>Sigma Chi</u>, played by the Lucky Strike Dance Orchestra.
 
8.(<u>THE SWEETHEART OF SIGMA CHI - ORCHESTRA</u>)  

	<u>MR. ROLFE</u>: All nations are invited to dance "The International 

	           Patrol" played by the Lucky Strike Dance Orchestra.  

9.(<u>INTERNATIONAL PATROL - ORCHESTRA</u>)

	<u>ANNOUNCER</u>:

	      A short time ago the world was thrilled by the daring of 

	Amelia Earhart, the first woman ever to cross the Atlantic 

	Ocean by airplane. Of Lucky Strike cigarettes Miss Earhart said 

	"Lucky Strikes were the cigarettes carried on the Friendship

	when she crossed the Atlantic. We bought a carton in Newfound-  

	land before we took off, because Luckies are best. On a long 

	hard grind of this kind they were real life-savers, and were  

	smoked continuously from Trepassey to Wales. I think nothing 

	else helped so much to lesson the strain for all of us." The  

	makers of Lucky Strikes thank Miss Earhart - "Lady Lindy" for 

	her high praise of Lucky Strike cigarettes.  

	<u>LOCAL ANNOUNCEMENT</u>:

	<u>MR. ROLFE</u>: This is a combination of the program of the Lucky 

	           Strike Dance Orchestra. Here's a musical conception 

	           of troubled sleep, caused by Welsh Rarebit - <u>The</u>

	           <u>Nightmare</u>.

10.(<u>THE NIGHTMARE - ORCHESTRA</u>)  

	<u>MR. ROLFE</u>: Dance, now, to the strains of <u>The Twelve O'Clock Waltz</u> 

	           by the Lucky Strike Dance Orchestra.

11.(<u>THE TWELVE O'CLOCK WALTZ - ORCHESTRA</u>)

	<u>MR. ROLFE</u>: An optimistic little melody, <u>Old Man Sunshine</u>, is  

	           your next invitation to the dance, by the Lucky 

	           Strike Dance Orchestra.

12.(<u>OLD MAN SUNSHINE - ORCHESTRA</u>)  

	<u>MR. ROLFE</u>: Next "Then Came the Dawn" and "Hallelujah" played by 

	           the Lucky Strike Dance Orchestra.  

13.(<u>THEN CAME THE DAWN - ORCHESTRA</u>)

14.(<u>HALLELUJAH - ORCHESTRA</u>)

	<u>MR. ROLFE</u>: The Lucky Strike Dance Orchestra sets a sizzling pace

	<u>CLOSING ANNOUNCEMENT</u>:

	     Theme tune - One chorus of <u>This Is My Lucky Day</u> with vocal 

	refrain, immediately followed by announcer:
