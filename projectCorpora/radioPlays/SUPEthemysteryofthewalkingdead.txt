MUSIC: FANFARE ... THEN IN BG

NARRATOR: When the planet Krypton, home of a race of supermen, exploded into 
dust, the sole survivor was an infant boy who had been shot to Earth in a 
sealed rocket. Today that boy, grown to manhood, is known as Superman, sworn 
enemy of the forces of evil. To aid him in his never-ending fight for truth 
and justice, he masquerades as Clark Kent, crime reporter for a great 
metropolitan newspaper. His secret is carefully guarded. No one is aware that 
Kent is Superman -- no one but <u>you</u>. 

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

NARRATOR: Join with us now on ABC as we embark on one of Superman's 
transcribed adventures -- as the Man of Steel finds himself pitted against an 
unseen enemy in "The Mystery of the Walking Dead."

MUSIC: MYSTERIOSO INTRO ... THEN IN BG, WITH STINGS AND ACCENTS AT [X]

NARRATOR: A feeble yellow light burns endlessly outside one of the death house 
cells of State Prison. Beyond the black steel door with its tiny barred 
opening, hemmed in by blank walls of ash-gray concrete, a man is seated on an 
iron cot. He is thin and gaunt, with great dark eyes and hollow sunken cheeks. 
He is an East Indian and his name is Krishna. Soon they will come to shave his 
head and slit the leg of his prison trousers. And soon after that, they will 
lead him from his cell and he will walk the last mile into everlasting 
darkness. [X] But now he sits quietly. The yellow light passing through the 
barred opening in the cell door lays an eerie pattern across his lean swarthy 
face. [X] Suddenly, his jaw tightens. He rises from the cot and moves to the 
steel door, his long sensitive fingers curling about the bars like snakes. He 
waits patiently while the hollow footfalls of the guard patrolling the 
corridor draw closer and closer. When they reach the cell, he speaks.

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

KRISHNA: I have a request to make.

GUARD: What is it?

KRISHNA: You will please to inform the warden it is my desire to speak with 
him.

GUARD: Be along pretty soon now.

KRISHNA: I cannot wait for "soon." It is my desire to speak with him at once. 
Do you question the wish of a condemned man?

GUARD: Easy, easy.

KRISHNA: You will please to inform him.

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN IN BG

NARRATOR: Almost hypnotized by the huge dark eyes glaring at him through the 
bars, the prison guard turns and retraces his steps along the corridor.

MUSIC: QUICK GLISS FOR A TRANSITION ... THEN OUT BEHIND--

NARRATOR: Meanwhile, in the editorial offices of the Metropolis Daily Planet 
-- now almost deserted with the last edition off the presses -- Lois Lane, the 
paper's star girl reporter, is anxiously pacing the floor while Clark Kent 
pleads with her to relax.

KENT: You'll end up with a nervous breakdown if you're not careful, Lois. 
Look, why don't you go home and take a nice--?

LOIS: What time is it?

KENT: Nine thirty.

LOIS: (EXPLODES) You're crazy! Your watch must have stopped. Why, it was nine 
o'clock--! (CATCHES HERSELF, BEAT) I'm sorry, Clark.

KENT: Sorry for what?

LOIS: Screaming at you. You're right. I <u>will</u> have a nervous breakdown if I'm 
not careful.

KENT: It isn't worth it, Lois.

LOIS: I know, but they're gonna kill a man up there tonight. He's going to 
<u>die</u>.

KENT: Well, lots of men will be dying tonight all over the world.

LOIS: But I'm not responsible for <u>them</u>.

KENT: You're not responsible for Krishna, either.

LOIS: I dug up the story, I had him arrested, I testified against him in 
court! I sent him to the chair!

KENT: All of which was no more than he deserved. Now, don't waste any sympathy 
on a guy that--

LOIS: I'm not wasting sympathy, Clark. You don't understand. If they chained 
him to a wall and kept him in a dungeon for the rest of his natural life, I 
wouldn't give it another thought. Really! But whatever he's done, he's still a 
human being -- a creature of flesh and blood -- and they're going to kill him!

KENT: What you're trying to say is--

LOIS: I'm not trying to say anything. I just want it to be over and done with. 
I sat in that courtroom for three weeks, watching him get tangled in his own 
web; looking at him and wondering what was going through his mind; asking 
myself why a cultured, intelligent, religious man--

KENT: Oh, now wait a minute--

LOIS: Yes, he <u>was</u> religious, in his own way.

KENT: A way that gave him a license to prey on the superstitious fears of 
helpless women, I suppose? To steal from them, to - to pauperize them, to 
murder them!

LOIS: Oh, of course not, but--

KENT: Krishna used his kind of phony black magic religion as a means to an 
end. He used it as a smoke screen. How can you possibly call him religious 
when you know he has human blood on his hands? And furthermore--

SOUND: PHONE RINGS

LOIS: (STARTLED GASP)

KENT: I'll take it.

SOUND: RECEIVER UP ... WARDEN'S VOICE ON FILTER

KENT: Hello?

WARDEN: Miss Lois Lane, please.

KENT: Who's calling?

WARDEN: Warden Reid, of State Prison.

KENT: Oh, hello, Warden. This is Clark Kent.

WARDEN: Oh, hello, Kent. How are you?

LOIS: Is it Warden Reid?

KENT: (TO LOIS) Yes. (INTO PHONE) Fine, thanks. And you?

WARDEN: Getting along.

KENT: Good.

LOIS: What does he want?

KENT: (TO LOIS) I don't know yet.

WARDEN: I'll tell you why I called, Kent.

KENT: Uh huh?

WARDEN: Is Miss Lane there?

KENT: She's standing right beside me.

WARDEN: Well, then you can pass it on.

KENT: Okay, go ahead.

WARDEN: Uh, as you know, Krishna goes to the chair tonight. The Court of 
Appeals refused him a new trial this morning and the governor turned him down 
on a stay early this evening.

KENT: Yes, I know.

WARDEN: Well, just a few minutes ago, he sent for me; said he had a final 
request to make.

KENT: Oh?

WARDEN: I told him we'd grant it if it were humanly possible. He said we <u>had</u> 
to grant it because it was the only way he would clear his conscience.

KENT: What was the request?

WARDEN: He says he wants to see Miss Lane before he dies.

KENT: What?!

LOIS: What is it, Clark?

KENT: (INTO PHONE) Hold it a minute, Warden.

WARDEN: Okay.

LOIS: What's happened, Clark? Is anything wrong?

KENT: Now, take it easy.

LOIS: Well, tell me -- don't just stand there!

KENT: Krishna wants to see <u>you</u> before he goes to the chair.

LOIS: Why?

KENT: Oh, some nonsense about clearing his conscience. Your answer, of course, 
is no. (INTO PHONE) Hello, Warden?

WARDEN: Yes, Kent?

LOIS: No, Clark! Wait! Clark--

KENT: (INTO PHONE) Just a minute, Warden.

WARDEN: All right.

KENT: Now, Lois, don't go off the deep end.

LOIS: The man is going to die, Clark. He only has a few hours left. What 
difference does it make?

KENT: Have you ever been in a prison death house? Have you ever seen a 
condemned man's face?

LOIS: My feelings don't matter. Let me have the phone.

KENT: Now, don't do it, Lois. Lois, I--!

LOIS: Please, Clark, <u>please</u>--!

KENT: (EXHALES UNHAPPILY)

LOIS: (INTO PHONE) Hello, Warden?

WARDEN: Yes?

LOIS: This is Lois Lane.

WARDEN: Yes, Miss Lane?

LOIS: (RELUCTANT) I'll be at the prison in - in twenty minutes.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS IN PRISON CORRIDOR ... IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

WARDEN: Do you understand, Miss Lane, you're under no obligation to this man 
and consenting to accede to his request is purely voluntary on your part?

LOIS: (SOBERLY) Yes, I understand.

KENT: Well, I think it's ridiculous to expose--

LOIS: Clark, now, we had all this out on the way up.

WARDEN: This is as far as you go, Kent.

KENT: I won't allow Miss Lane in the death house alone.

SOUND: DOOR UNLOCKS AND OPENS

WARDEN: She won't be alone. There'll be two guards and myself.

KENT: Why can't I accompany her?

LOIS: Stop it, Clark, please.

WARDEN: It's regulations, Kent.

KENT: (DISMISSIVE) Ohhh.

WARDEN: We'll be back in a few minutes. (TO GUARD) Close up, Regan.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES AND LOCKS

LOIS: Sorry if Mr. Kent seemed insistent.

WARDEN: Not at all. Frankly, I agree with him. This can't be a very pleasant 
experience for you. Well, this is the cell, Miss Lane. (TO GUARD) Miller, you 
and Harkin stand out here. I'll go in.

GUARD: Yes, sir.

WARDEN: Open up.

SOUND: CELL DOOR UNLOCKS AND OPENS

WARDEN: Krishna, Miss Lane is here to see you.

KRISHNA: Thank you. Thank you kindly.

WARDEN: Step in, Miss Lane. (BEAT) You have three minutes.

KRISHNA: May I speak with the young lady alone?

WARDEN: No, you may not.

KRISHNA: Very well. Please to be seated, Miss Lane.

LOIS: (QUIETLY NERVOUS) If you don't mind, I'd rather stand.

KRISHNA: As you wish. I requested to speak with you, Miss Lane, because I do 
not desire that you forever carry within your heart the knowledge that you 
bore false witness against me. 

LOIS: That isn't true! I testified what I--

KRISHNA: Please! There is little time and I have much to say. I bear you no 
malice for what you have done to me. The body is but the dwelling place of the 
soul. You have spoken against only this feeble thing of blood and nerve and 
sinew that they will destroy -- that they will singe and burn until the flesh 
is no more!

LOIS: (UNNERVED, INCREASINGLY HYSTERICAL) Please!

KRISHNA: But neither you nor they can reach beyond the pale of death.

LOIS: Please, don't--!

KRISHNA: I, Krishna, will return in spirit, in voice -- yes, even in 
substance! I will rise like a phoenix from my lifeless corpse, like a new 
messiah, and you will hear my voice, you will look upon my countenance, and 
then you will know--!

LOIS: Stop it! Stop it!

WARDEN: That's enough, Krishna.

KRISHNA: I have more to say!

LOIS: Nooo!

WARDEN: Step outside, Miss Lane.

KRISHNA: Do you deny the final wish of a condemned man?

WARDEN: (CURT) You had your wish. (TO GUARD) Lock up, Miller.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES AND LOCKS

KRISHNA: (CALLS) There is no escape! So it is spoken in the Kabala: "And it 
shall come to pass that he will rise from the grave! And he shall be the 
walking dead! And there shall be no escape from him! Even unto eternity!"

MUSIC: SNEAKS IN DURING ABOVE, BUILDS TO BRIDGE

SOUND: RUNNING AUTO INTERIOR BACKGROUND

KENT: I don't like to second-guess, Lois, but if you'd only listened to me, 
you could have avoided that horrible experience.

LOIS: Please, Clark, let's not talk about it. I - I've had all I can take for 
the night. Do you mind if I turn on the radio?

KENT: No, of course not.

SOUND: CLICK! OF RADIO SWITCHED ON

KENT: You're not going back to the office, you know. I'm taking you right to 
your apartment.

LOIS: No, I've got to-- I've got to do a story on that--

KRISHNA: (ON RADIO) And it shall come to pass that he will rise from the 
grave--

LOIS: (TERRIFIED) Clark!

KRISHNA: (ON RADIO) --and he shall be the walking dead!

KENT: What's the matter?

LOIS: Clark!

KRISHNA: (ON RADIO) And there shall be no escape from him! 

LOIS: That's <u>his</u> voice!

KENT: What?

KRISHNA: (ON RADIO) Even unto eternity!

LOIS: That's what he screamed at me!

SOUND: SCREECH! OF BRAKES AS CAR STOPS

MUSIC: SOMBER ORGAN ... ON RADIO, IN BG

KENT: What are you talking about?

LOIS: Krishna's voice! Didn't you hear it?!

KENT: Lois, what's gotten into you? That's a radio program.

LOIS: Turn it off! Turn it off!

MUSIC: OUT WITH--

SOUND: CLICK! OF RADIO SWITCHED OFF

KENT: Now, listen to me, Lois--

LOIS: Clark! Take me home! <u>Please</u>! Take me <u>home</u>!

SOUND: APARTMENT DOOR OPENS ... STEPS IN

KENT: You sure you're gonna be all right, Lois?

LOIS: (BEAT, UNCONVINCING) Yes. What time is it?

KENT: Uh, eleven fifteen.

LOIS: Oh. Then it's all over.

KENT: Huh?

LOIS: He went to the chair at eleven.

KENT: Oh, Lois, you've <u>got</u> to stop thinking about that.

LOIS: I know. I will. Good night, Clark. I'm sorry I've been behaving so 
stupidly.

KENT: Oh, forget it. I'll see you in the office.

LOIS: Okay. Good night.

KENT: Good night.

SOUND: APARTMENT DOOR CLOSES

LOIS: (TO HERSELF) Oh-- Hope I never have to go through anything like that 
again as long as I live. Those eyes. Those huge dark eyes. Burning holes in 
me. And that horrible screaming.

SOUND: PHONE RINGS ... THEN IN BG

LOIS: (TO HERSELF) Who can that be at this hour of the night?

SOUND: LOIS' STEPS TO PHONE ... RECEIVER UP

LOIS: Hello?

KRISHNA: (ON PHONE) And it shall come to pass that he will rise from the 
grave--

LOIS: (BLOODCURDLING SCREAM)

KRISHNA: (ON PHONE) --and he shall be the walking dead.

SOUND: RECEIVER DROPPED

KENT: (OFF) Lois?! Open the door!

SOUND: RATTLE OF LOCKED DOOR

KENT: (OFF) Lois?!

SOUND: RATTLE OF LOCKED DOOR

KENT: (OFF) Lois?! Lois!

MUSIC: TOPS THE SCENE ... AGITATED BRIDGE

LOIS: (TEARFUL) But, Clark, I swear to you, when I lifted the phone, his voice 
came over the wire and it said the same thing! The same thing he screamed at 
me from the cell. The same thing I heard on the radio.

KENT: Now, Lois, I don't have to tell <u>you</u> about the power of fear. You know 
what it can do to people.

LOIS: I - I'm not afraid of anything! You refuse to believe that!

KENT: Yes, you are! You're afraid of the unknown.

LOIS: Well, that is--

KENT: You exposed yourself to that half-demented fanatic and he threatened you 
with mystic mumbo-jumbo -- and now you're hearing things!

LOIS: Clark! Look, I'm not crazy. I'm terribly upset, but I'm not crazy. The 
phone rang and when I lifted the receiver--

KENT: I know, I know, I know. Now you listen to me. I'm gonna call the prison.

LOIS: I--

KENT: If the warden tells ya that Krishna went to the chair at eleven o'clock 
-- that he's dead -- will ya stop all this nonsense?

LOIS: You don't have to call. It isn't necessary.

KENT: Well, I think it is.

SOUND: RECEIVER UP ... DIALS FOR OPERATOR ... OPERATOR AND WARDEN'S VOICES ON 
FILTER

OPERATOR: Number, please?

KENT: Operator, this is an emergency call to Warden Reid at the state prison 
in Malverne.

OPERATOR: What is your number?

KENT: Hanover Six Two-Three-Nine-Two.

OPERATOR: And your name?

KENT: Clark Kent.

OPERATOR: One moment, please.

KENT: Thank you. (BEAT, TO LOIS) Lois, I'm gonna let you talk to him so there 
won't be any question about it. This thing could make nervous wrecks of both 
of us.

LOIS: Yes.

KENT: Believe me, when I was standing out in the hall waiting for the elevator 
and I heard you scream, I thought you were being murdered.

LOIS: How did you get in?

KENT: Huh? Oh, I - I - I forced the door open.

LOIS: But how - how could you, Clark? That door has a double lock.

KENT: I know, but when you're desperate, you do a lot of things you ordinarily 
couldn't do. I - I guess I just sort of made believe I was Superman and--

OPERATOR: Ready with Warden Reid.

KENT: (INTO PHONE) Oh, thank you. Hello?

WARDEN: Er, yes? Kent?

KENT: Warden, I'm calling from Miss Lane's apartment. I'm gonna put her on the 
phone and I want you to tell her that Krishna's execution went off as 
scheduled.

WARDEN: I'm sorry, Kent, but it didn't.

KENT: What?

WARDEN: He cheated the chair.

KENT: I don't understand.

LOIS: Clark? What happened?

KENT: (TO LOIS) Wait a minute. 

LOIS: What--?

WARDEN: Hello? Hello?

KENT: Yes, Warden, I'm here.

WARDEN: I thought we were disconnected.

KENT: No, no. I'm still on. You say he <u>wasn't</u> executed?

LOIS: (GASPS)

WARDEN: Er, no. We found him dead in his cell at ten minutes to eleven -- 
heart attack.

KENT: I see.

WARDEN: I'm just as well satisfied. You know how I feel about executions.

KENT: Oh, yes. Yes, I know. Well, that's that. Thanks, Warden.

WARDEN: That's quite all right.

KENT: Bye.

WARDEN: Goodbye.

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN

KENT: Okay? He's dead.

LOIS: You just said he wasn't executed. I heard you say that.

KENT: (DELIBERATELY) He died in his cell from a heart attack.

LOIS: (BEAT) Clark, I <u>knew</u> something like this was going to happen!

KENT: What?

LOIS: I just had a feeling it would!

KENT: Something like what?

LOIS: He isn't dead! I know he isn't! He isn't dead, Clark!

KENT: Do you know what you're saying? Now wait a minute -- you're calling 
Warden Reid a liar and you're calling me a liar.

LOIS: You don't understand!

KENT: Lois--

LOIS: They <u>think</u> he's dead! They just <u>think</u> that!

KENT: Lois, look at me. Look at me, I said. What's happened to you? Are you 
losing your mind?!

LOIS: Clark, please! Try to understand this--

KENT: There's nothing to understand except that you -- a sane, logical, 
intelligent person in the twentieth century -- are allowing yourself to be 
influenced by primitive witchcraft, by black magic!

LOIS: Now wait a minute! Just let me tell you something!

KENT: What?

LOIS: I spent a lot of time in Krishna's so-called Temple of Truth getting the 
story.

KENT: I know you did.

LOIS: And I saw an awful lot of things that couldn't be explained. This man 
has a kind of -- power.

KENT: Well, sure! That's what I'm trying to tell ya. The power of suggestion!

LOIS: Clark, that isn't what I mean.

KENT: Look-- Wait a minute now, wait. If people kept telling you that you 
looked bad -- that - that you were sick-- If they kept harping on it over and 
over again,  do you know what would happen?

LOIS: I--

KENT: You'd <u>get</u> sick, Lois. You might even die. Why, good heavens, there are 
people who talk themselves into imaginary illnesses, let alone having anyone 
else do it.

LOIS: That isn't what I mean. You know what catalepsis is?

KENT: Sure. A state of trance.

LOIS: Yes. Well, I saw Krishna put people into cataleptic trances. Their 
bodies stiffened as though they were dead and rigor mortis had set in.

KENT: Well?

LOIS: I saw that with my own eyes, Clark! And if he can do that for others, 
why can't he do it for himself?

KENT: (AMUSED SKEPTICISM) Oh ho, now, Lois -- it's one thing to work black 
magic in a half-darkened voodoo temple--

LOIS: I tell you--

KENT: It's quite another thing to do it in a prison cell with a prison doctor 
standing by. Now, you take my word for it: Krishna is dead. Dead and gone.

SOUND: PHONE RINGS ... THEN IN BG

LOIS: (GASPS) Don't answer that, Clark!

KENT: Why not?

LOIS: Please! Please don't answer it!

KENT: Lois--

LOIS: Clark, don't answer it!

KENT: Lois, let go of my arm. Now don't be stupid.

LOIS: Call it stupid, call it anything you want, but please don't answer it!

KRISHNA: (ON PHONE) And it shall come to pass that he will rise from the grave 
and he shall be the--

MUSIC: TOPS THE SCENE ... CURTAIN  

NARRATOR: We'll return in just a moment to "The Adventures of Superman" and 
"The Mystery of the Walking Dead." But first, a word from your ABC announcer.

ABC ANNCR: I'd like to talk to you now about America's Community Chest, which 
is currently campaigning for funds to continue its fine work. Its goal is one 
hundred and eighty-five million dollars and all of it will be spent for the 
maintenance and administration of Red Feather services through the community. 
These services are vital to the health and welfare of millions of our 
citizens. Typical of these services are: aid to the handicapped and homes for 
the aged, hospitals, maternity homes, neighborhood houses, visiting nurses, 
and children's aid. And then the Community Chest helps support such fine 
organizations as the Boy and Girl Scouts, Salvation Army, the U.S.O., 
Travelers Aid, and the Y.M. and the Y.W.C.A.'s. The Community Chest is a 
thoroughgoing American idea that wins a warm response from all of us. We can 
be sure that our nation is sound at the core when citizens unite 
wholeheartedly and of their own free will build a good community spirit in 
their own hometowns. Give freely this year to your local Community Chest.

NARRATOR: And now back to "The Adventures of Superman" and "The Mystery of the 
Walking Dead." 

MUSIC: MYSTERIOSO INTRO ... THEN BEHIND NARRATOR--

NARRATOR: Obsessed with the thought that Krishna, an East Indian mystic, is 
not dead despite the prison warden's report that he died in his cell of a 
heart attack fifteen minutes before his scheduled execution, Lois Lane, whose 
newspaper exposé of the mystic's Temple of Truth helped convict him, spent a 
tortured, sleepless night. It is now the following morning. Clark Kent is in 
the warden's office at the state prison.

KENT: And you say the doctor's certain beyond the question of a doubt that 
when he examined Krishna he was dead?

WARDEN: Here's the report, Kent. Coronary occlusion.

KENT: Uh huh. Was an autopsy done on the body?

WARDEN: No, we're not equipped for that up here.

KENT: No?

WARDEN: Unclaimed bodies are sometimes turned over to medical schools or 
hospitals, but, generally speaking, most of them <u>are</u> claimed by relatives or 
friends for burial.

KENT: What happened to Krishna's body?

WARDEN: I believe it was claimed last night.

KENT: Oh?

SOUND: SHUFFLE OF PAPERS

WARDEN: It should be in one of these reports. Ah, here. Here it is. (READS) 
"Claimed by Midtown Mortuary Service on behalf of a brother, Ali Yatanga 
Nabba."

KENT: That was last night?

WARDEN: Yes. Body was found around ten forty-six stretched out on the cot in 
the cell.

KENT: Did <u>you</u> see it?

WARDEN: Yes, of course. When the guard notified me, I went to the cell with 
the doctor.

KENT: And you saw Krishna's body?

WARDEN: Yes. Why are you making a point of that, Kent?

KENT: Well, I'll tell you why. Miss Lane and I left here last night at ten 
fifteen. At about ten twenty-five, she turned on the car radio.

WARDEN: Yes?

KENT: The voice she heard -- she says -- was Krishna's. And the words he spoke 
were the same words he screamed at her from his cell.

WARDEN: But that's impossible, Kent. At ten twenty-five he was in his cell -- 
either dead or alive.

KENT: That's what puzzles me. She heard his voice again over the phone at 
eleven fifteen. And <u>I</u> heard it ten minutes later!

WARDEN: You what?

KENT: But that could be explained.

WARDEN: How? Since when do dead men talk over the telephone?

KENT: Well, assuming he wasn't dead -- that he was in a - a cataleptic 
trance--

WARDEN: (DISMISSIVE) Oh, no.

KENT: If his body was claimed before eleven fifteen and he was brought out of 
the trance, he <u>could</u> have made those phone calls.

WARDEN: Kent, the man died of a heart attack. Dr. Bronson has been the staff 
physician here for fifteen years and I assure you that when he pronounced 
Krishna dead, he was dead. I'm sorry he's not on duty now so he could tell it 
to you himself.

KENT: Oh, now don't misunderstand me, Warden. I'm not questioning it for a 
moment. It's just that-- Well, there doesn't seem to be any other explanation. 
Unless you believe in the supernatural.

WARDEN: If I were you, I'd forget about it.

KENT: It's too late for that. Miss Lane is in a state of collapse, and 
frankly, <u>I'm</u> getting worried. No, I've got to track this down; find an 
explanation for it. Well, I'll stop off at the Midtown Mortuary before I go 
back to Miss Lane's apartment.

WARDEN: They'll tell you he was dead.

KENT: Well, if they do, fine. Then if the dead <u>can</u> come to life, I want to 
know about that, too!

MUSIC: BRIDGE

LOIS: You - you're not holding anything back, are you, Clark?

KENT: Now, why should I hold anything back?

LOIS: Well, I--

KENT: I told you what the warden said and I told you what I learned at the 
mortuary. They received the body at eleven thirty, it was embalmed this 
morning, and it's now lying in state at the Temple of Truth.

LOIS: Yes, but then how did we hear his voice last night? You can't say it was 
my imagination because you heard it, too.

KENT: I don't know, but we've established one thing, at any rate: he's not 
alive; he's dead.

LOIS: Was he alive when I heard him on the radio?

KENT: You couldn't have heard him.

LOIS: I did!

KENT: He was in his cell, Lois. Now, that was definitely your imagination. 
What you heard was the end of a mystery program.

LOIS: Was it? Here!

SOUND: RUSTLE OF NEWSPAPER

LOIS: This is yesterday's paper, Clark.

KENT: Well?

LOIS: There <u>were</u> no mystery programs on between ten and ten-thirty last night. 
I went even further than that. I checked <u>all</u> the programs on at that time. 
They were music and a comedy show, and quiz shows, and news. There was nothing 
else!

KENT: And you still think he's alive?

LOIS: Don't ask me what I think! I'm telling you what I <u>know</u>, what I heard, 
what <u>you</u> heard!

KENT: Okay, then there's only one thing to do.

LOIS: What?

KENT: Krishna's body is lying in state at the Temple of Truth. You and I are 
going over there to see it!

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: CITY TRAFFIC BACKGROUND

KENT: Well, no wonder he could afford five lawyers at his trial. This place 
must have cost a fortune to build.

LOIS: Clark, I - I'm afraid to go in there. All the attendants know me.

KENT: Well, drop the veil over your face; let's see what it looks like. (BEAT) 
Oh, no one could possibly recognize you, Lois.

LOIS: Sure it's all right?

KENT: Sure. Don't worry now. Come on.

SOUND: THEIR STEPS INTO TEMPLE ... TEMPLE DOOR CLOSES ... CITY TRAFFIC OUT ... 
REPLACED BY QUIET TEMPLE BACKGROUND ... SLIGHT ECHO ON VOICES ... EVERYONE 
SPEAKS SOFTLY

MUSIC: FUNEREAL, SLIGHTLY EERIE ORGAN BACKGROUND

KENT: So dark in here, no one would recognize you even without the black veil.

LOIS: Hope you're right.

ATTENDANT: Your membership cards, please.

LOIS: (SLIGHT GASP)

KENT: Huh? I beg your pardon?

ATTENDANT: We are admitting only members of the temple today.

KENT: Oh, well, er-- We're members, but we've forgotten our cards. We've come 
a long way to pay our respects to Krishna.

ATTENDANT: May I have your names?

KENT: Our names?

ATTENDANT: If you please.

KENT: Oh, er, Mr. and Mrs.-- (GRUNTS WITH EFFORT)

SOUND: CLARK SOCKS THE ATTENDANT

ATTENDANT: (GRUNTS IN PAIN)

LOIS: Clark! What did you do?

KENT: Knocked him out.

LOIS: Oh, no!

KENT: Where can I dump him?

LOIS: I - I don't know.

KENT: Think, think! I can't stand here holding him in my arms.

LOIS: Wait a minute. Uh, uh-- Oh, there's a coat room behind that pillar.

KENT: (MOVING OFF) Okay, I'll be right back. (BEAT, THEN RETURNS) All right. 
He's stowed away.

LOIS: Yes, but look -- what'll happen when he comes to?

KENT: He'll be out long enough for us to look around. Now, the casket's up 
front. Let's join the line passing it.

SOUND: LOIS AND CLARK JOIN THE LINE ... THEY WHISPER

LOIS: I'm scared to death.

KENT: Why? They can't do anything to us.

LOIS: I don't know.

KENT: (BEAT) Where do all these people come from? Evidently, they're planning 
to carry on without Krishna.

LOIS: Looks that way.

KENT: Wonder how the police feel about that. And the D. A.'s office.

LOIS: Clark? See that woman looking into the casket? She owns half of downtown 
Metropolis. She testified <u>for</u> Krishna at the trial.

KENT: It's amazing how people can be deluded.

LOIS: Isn't it?

KENT: Okay, we're next. Get a good look at him.

MUSIC: UP SLIGHTLY TO FILL A PAUSE AS LOIS AND KENT PASS THE CASKET

KENT: Well? Are you convinced now?

LOIS: (BEAT) Yes.

2ND ATTENDANT: (SLIGHTLY SINISTER ANNOUNCEMENT) The doors will now be locked.

LOIS: (GASPS, WHISPERS) Clark?

2ND ATTENDANT: All members will please be seated.

LOIS: (WHISPERS, TO KENT) What do we do now?

KENT: Nothing, nothing. Let's take these two aisle seats.

LOIS: Yes, but what'll happen when--?

KENT: Sh! Now don't worry. (BEAT) Look! The lights are dimming over the 
casket. We're in for something.

LOIS: Clark, you don't know these people. Please, let's get out of here.

KENT: Can't get out now. The doors are locked.

LOIS: Oh, why did I ever let you talk me into this? Why?

MUSIC: ORGAN MUSIC GENTLY OUT

KENT: Just a dim [light] by the casket now. The organ music stopped. I wonder 
what--

KRISHNA: And so it is spoken in the Kabala--

LOIS: (GASPS, WHISPERS) That's Krishna's voice!

KENT: Easy, Lois.

KRISHNA: And it shall come to pass that he will rise from the grave! 

LOIS: That's his voice, Clark!

KENT: Sh!

KRISHNA: And become the walking dead! 

LOIS: Where's it coming from?

KENT: I don't know, but that's just the beginning. You're gonna see something 
in just a moment.

MUSIC: ORGAN ACCENT ... THEN IN BG

LOIS: (GASPS)

KENT: See it?

LOIS: Oh! He's rising from the casket! He's coming to life!

MUSIC: ORGAN OUT GENTLY BEHIND--

KENT: This is too much. I'm going out to call Inspector Henderson.

LOIS: You can't get out! The doors are locked!

KENT: I'll get out. You sit tight.

LOIS: No, no, don't leave me!

KENT: I'll be right back.

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN IN BG, IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING, WITH ACCENTS AT 
[X]--

NARRATOR: Slipping from his seat, Clark Kent hurries up the aisle of the 
darkened temple, unnoticed by the audience who stare transfixed at the seeming 
miracle taking place before their eyes. Ducking into an alcove, he quickly 
removes his horn-rimmed glasses and strips off the dark business suit that 
serves as his disguise, revealing himself in the familiar blue costume and red 
cape of <u>Superman</u>! [X] Stepping out of the alcove, his eyes sweep the huge 
auditorium. [X] Suddenly, he stiffens. Lois is missing from the seat where he 
left her. On the raised platform behind the casket, the figure of Krishna 
stands erect now, bathed in a cold blue light, hands extended to the 
congregation -- but Lois is nowhere to be seen. The organ begins its deep 
throbbing notes again, wailing like a lost soul. Superman starts for the 
aisle. But, as he does, two men close in on him out of the shadowed darkness.

2ND ATTENDANT: Where do you think you're going?

SUPERMAN: That's my business. But I know where <u>you're</u> going. To sleep!

SOUND: SUPERMAN PUNCHES ATTENDANT

2ND ATTENDANT: (EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

SOUND: BODY THUDS TO FLOOR ... ANOTHER ATTENDANT'S STEPS APPROACH

SUPERMAN: (EXHALES) Oh, you want some shuteye, too, eh? (WITH EFFORT) All 
right. Glad to oblige.

SOUND: SUPERMAN PUNCHES ATTENDANT 

SUPERMAN: (EXHALES)

SOUND: BODY THUDS TO FLOOR

MUSIC: UP FOR ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND NARRATOR--

NARRATOR: Turning to the aisle again, Superman is just in time to see a 
blinding flash of light envelop the figure of Krishna. Smoke billows up from 
the casket at his feet. When it clears, the figure is gone!

MUSIC: UP FOR ACCENT ... THEN IN BG--

NARRATOR: Meanwhile, with a gun in her back, Lois is being forced down a 
narrow corridor behind the temple platform. As she reaches the end of the 
corridor, a door opens and a voice says--

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

KRISHNA: Come in, Miss Lane.

LOIS: (GASPS)

KRISHNA: Come in, I said!

LOIS: Oh, no!

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES

KRISHNA: You did not expect to see me again in life, did you, Miss Lane?

LOIS: You - you better not try anything. I didn't come here alone.

KRISHNA: Your friend is no longer in a position to help you.

LOIS: Please--

KRISHNA: In fact, I might say, you are beyond all human help.

LOIS: Oh, no--

KRISHNA: Your life is now in my hands. And I have sworn by all the gods of 
Vishnu to make you suffer for what you did to me.

LOIS: Stay away from me.

KRISHNA: Yes!

LOIS: Stay away from me.

KRISHNA: Cringe. Cringe against the wall. What would you give now to have the 
floor open and swallow you? What?!

LOIS: (DEFIANT) Nothing. I - I'm not afraid of you. You - you don't dare to 
touch me.

KRISHNA: (CHUCKLES)

LOIS: The police know that I came here today.

KRISHNA: (LAUGHS) That, Miss Lane, is a feeble threat. You are aware I cannot 
be destroyed. You know I am invincible. But you <u>can</u> be destroyed.

LOIS: Ohhh--

KRISHNA: And you are <u>going</u> to be destroyed!

LOIS: (STRAINED) Oh, no! No, you're choking me! (CHOKES AND MOANS, CONTINUES 
IN BG)

KRISHNA: I will choke the breath of life from your body. Can you feel the 
blood pounding in your temples? Can you feel your lungs bursting?  

LOIS: (MOANS WEAKLY, IN BG) 

KRISHNA: This is the moment before your death. The glorious throbbing moment 
before death. You're getting weak now. You no longer struggle. Die. Die, I 
say. I will avenge thee--

SOUND: SUPERMAN CRASHES THROUGH DOOR

SUPERMAN: You'll avenge nothing!

LOIS: Superman?

SOUND: SUPERMAN GRABS KRISHNA WHO STRUGGLES, IN BG

KRISHNA: (STRUGGLES AND GRUNTS, IN BG)

SUPERMAN: No, no, my friend -- no guns and no knives! The party's over!

KRISHNA: Release me!

SUPERMAN: I'll release you -- to the police! You all right, Lois?

LOIS: Yes.

SUPERMAN: All right, we'll just pin this snake up against the wall and let him 
talk!

SOUND: SUPERMAN SLAMS KRISHNA INTO WALL

SUPERMAN: There!

KRISHNA: (MISERABLY) Put me down!

SUPERMAN: Tell Miss Lane who you are! Tell her you're not Krishna! Tell her!

KRISHNA: My arm! You're - you're breaking it!

SUPERMAN: I'll break every bone in your body unless you talk! Who are you?!

KRISHNA: I - I am Krishna's brother.

SUPERMAN: Is Krishna dead? (NO ANSWER) Talk!

KRISHNA: (DEFEATED) Yes. Yes.

SUPERMAN: Where's his body?

KRISHNA: Under the platform.

SUPERMAN: The casket had a false bottom, didn't it? You dropped his body down 
and you rose up from it. (NO RESPONSE) Well?

KRISHNA: Yes.

SUPERMAN: You were the one who made those phone calls to Miss Lane, weren't 
you?

KRISHNA: Yes.

SUPERMAN: Anything else you want to know, Lois?

LOIS: No. That's enough.

SUPERMAN: Okay. Then we can go -- straight to police headquarters!

MUSIC: TRIUMPHANT BRIDGE

LOIS: Clark? How did Superman happen to be at the temple?

KENT: (LIGHTLY) Well, now, that's an interesting question. I wish I could 
answer it for you.

LOIS: You mean you don't know?

KENT: No, that's not quite true.

LOIS: Well, if you <u>do</u> know, why can't you tell me?

KENT: That's an interesting question, too.

LOIS: Honestly, you're impossible.

KENT: (CHUCKLES)

LOIS: You know, incidentally, we never did find out about that radio 
broadcast.

KENT: Oh, I forgot to tell you. The Temple of Truth was on the air that night 
over a small local station.

LOIS: No? How strange.

KENT: It was just coincidence that you happened to tune in while Krishna's 
brother was mouthing that mumbo-jumbo.

LOIS: Yes, wasn't it?

KENT: Matter of fact, I missed the boat. When the warden told me his brother 
claimed the body, I should have put two and two together. Of course, if I'd 
known it was a twin brother, it would have been easy.

LOIS: Well, it's all over now. Oh, incidentally, did I tell you that Superman 
called me Lois?

KENT: Did he?

LOIS: (YES) Mm hm. Twice. (DREAMILY) Oh, he's really wonderful.

KENT: (GENUINELY) Thanks.

LOIS: Huh?

KENT: (LIGHTLY) I said, thanks -- for Superman.
