<u>MUSIC:		FULL INTO PLAY THEME .. AND DOWN, TO HOLD UNDER:</u>

<u>SOUND:		SHIP LOADING EFFECTS .. WINCHES, SHOUTS .. IN B.G.</u>

ROY:		The Orient. China. The Port of Hong Kong....A great

		passenger ship is almost ready to sail. And up on

		deck - leaning casually against the rail - two men

		watch the busy scene below....Two men standing quietly
            
		together. They might be old friends. They <u>might</u> be -

		<u>except that their wrists are joined by handcuffs</u>.

<u>MUSIC:		CUTS WITH</u>:

<u>SOUND:		STEAMER WHISTLE .. LONG WARNING BLAST</u>

DAN:		Well..there's the warning whistle, Steve....

STEVE:		That's right, Dan. We're on the last leg now. Honolulu -

		San Francisco -

DAN:		And then San Quentin....

STEVE:		(SLIGHT PAUSE) It's been a long chase, Dan.

DAN:		(FAINT SMILE) But interesting?

STEVE:		Sort of.

DAN:		You know, you ought to be grateful to me, Steve. How

		many cops ever get a trip around the world? Marseilles,

		Algiers, Cairo....And how did you like Paris? See

		anything of the town?

STEVE:		Your trail wasn't half bad.

DAN:		What about that little girl in Madrid?

STEVE:		Cheeter?

[2]

DAN:		Steve, forgive me if I correct you. Her name was

		Conchita...Didn't delay you much, did she?

STEVE:		No -- but it was nice to have her tryin'.. (SUDDENLY)

		And say, don't lean too hard against that rail; this

		section swings out.

DAN:		(GRINS) That would be fun -- a little dip before we

		sailed..You swim, Steve?

STEVE:		(WISELY) No -- but I play a swell game of tag.

DAN:		Ever play water polo?

STEVE:		Nope.

DAN:		(CHUCKLES) I used to be sensational. Have to teach

		you some time.

STEVE:		Don't try anything funny, Dan....

DAN:		(SHRUGS) What would be the percentage -- with this

		jewelry hooking us together? Suppose you'd lost the key?

STEVE:		Not me. I've got it right here in my vest pocket.

		(ADD QUICKLY) The side <u>away</u> from you..No, you're pretty

		smart, Dan, but I'm just one step ahead of -- (SUDDEN

		SHOUT) Hey, look out! (SCREAMS, FADING) <u>Dan</u> -- !

ENGLISHMAN:	(COMING IN, EXCITED) I saw it! I saw it all! The rail

		gave way! (OTHER VOICES GATHERING, EXCITED)

WOMAN:		Well, don't just stand there! <u>Do something</u>!

[3]

ENGLISHMAN:	By jove, you're right. (SHOUTS) Help! Man overboard!

		Help! Help!

<u>MUSIC:		INTO COVER...AND FADE OUT INTO....EXCITED VOICES...IN</u>

		<u>LOW B.G.</u>

JOAN:		(CALLS) Louise...(NO ANSWER) <u>Louise</u>....

LOUISE:		(SLIGHTLY OFF) Yes, Miss Joan -- ?

JOAN:		I've been calling. Where were you? (<u>DOOR CLOSE</u>)

LOUISE:		(COMING IN) I stepped out on deck. There's been an

		accident.

JOAN:		Yes, I know -- I heard the excitement. What happened,

		Louise?

LOUISE:		They say a man fell overboard.

JOAN:		(QUICKLY) When? How? Were they able to save him. Did

		they --

LOUISE:		(STOPPING HER) Miss Joan -- please -- you mustn't let

		yourself get worked up.

JOAN:		Don't be silly! Who's getting worked up?

LOUISE:		But the doctor said --

JOAN:		Oh, he's like all the rest! They've said too much to me

		already!.....(EXCITED) Louise, unpack my new silk dress.

		I'm going out on deck and -- (SUDDEN PAIN) -- and --

LOUISE:		(FRIGHTENED) Miss Joan -- !

JOAN:		(IN PAIN) My..my capsules..please....

[4]

LOUISE:		(QUICKLY) Here..Here....Now breathe deeply......

		That's it.....

JOAN:		(FAINTLY) I -- just felt a little faint, that's all.

LOUISE:		(FIRM) That's plenty. (<u>RECEIVER UP</u>) I'm going to

		telephone for the ship's doctor!!!

<u>MUSIC:		ACCENT CHORD...AND FADE OUT INTO</u>

DOCTOR:		Fortunate you had those capsules handy, Ma'am.

LOUISE:		(QUIETLY) We <u>always</u> have them handy, Doctor.

DOCTOR:		(GRAVELY) Yes....of course....

JOAN:		Doctor, I think it was silly to bother you. Just when

		they probably need you, too.

DOCTOR:		You think someone needed me more than you?

JOAN:		Well -- that man who fell overboard...If he couldn't

		swim.

DOCTOR:		He couldn't.

JOAN:		There you are! You see!

DOCTOR:		Matter of fact, he didn't need me at all...Seems he's

		travelling with another man -- very strong swimmer.

		Fellow went right in after him. They thrashed around

		bit -- and then the friend took over. Held them both up

		until they fished them out.

JOAN:		Oh.....

DOCTOR:		Now then young lady, you'll stay in bed and rest.

JOAN:		(SMILES) You're not very original. That's been said to

		me before.

[5]

DOCTOR:		Not much result..You don't obey doctors' orders,

		do you?

JOAN:		I used to. I don't any more.

DOCTOR:		I presume they told you how serious it is?

JOAN:		More than that -- I've read all about it.

DOCTOR:		It's a strong thing to have to say to a girl who's --

		well, to anyone, for that matter. But you understand

		that with exertion and excitement, it can happen almost

		any time?

JOAN:		Yes, doctor -- I understand. I'll send for you if I

		don't -- feel well.

DOCTOR:		You're going on to San Francisco?

JOAN:		San Francisco, and then New York. Then France -- then

		down through the Red Sea -- and then 'round the little

		world again.

DOCTOR:		(GRIMLY) That's a long trip.

JOAN:		Not nearly as long as lying in a sanitarium...They knew

		it was hopeless..and I knew it, too -- and I couldn't

		go on, just lying there, waiting for it to come to me.

		So I've been waltzing around the world, having what fun

		I could.....Is that such bad psychology, doctor?

DOCTOR:		Well, I can understand how you feel..but if you were

		my little girl you'd be staying in bed.

JOAN:		(SMILES) But since I'm not, I'm getting up.

[6]

DOCTOR:		And then?

JOAN:		I'm putting on my new silk dress.

DOCTOR:		And then?

JOAN:		I'm going up to the bar for a drink --

<u>MUSIC:		(ACCENT CHORD..AND FADE OUT INTO:)</u>

<u>SOUND:		WHISTLE</u>

STEVE:		Dan, I don't know how to say it to you..(A PAUSE) Dan --?

DAN:		Oh, I'm sorry, Steve -- I was looking out on deck....

		That girl is pretty, isn't she? The one in the silk

		dress.

STEVE:		You must be nuts!

DAN:		I'd like to prove that to the Governor. He might change

		the rap to just life.

STEVE:		(QUIETLY) Why'd you pull me out, Dan? Why didn't you

		let me drown?

DAN:		You know, I've been wondering about that myself.

STEVE:		You managed to get the key out of my pocket -- you got

		the irons off..Thanks, Dan. If I can do anything for you..

DAN:		You can, Steve.

STEVE:		(WARILY) What?

DAN:		These irons. Can't we cut the Siamese Twin Act now?

		We're out of the harbor -- I can't get away.

[7]

STEVE:		(CONSIDERS IT) No... that's true...you can't...(A PAUSE)

		Dan, I'm gonna give you half a break. I'm not gonna

		put you in the brig --

DAN:		(PLEASED) No?

STEVE:		(QUICKLY) But one move and you get it. I'd plug you

		without even thinking twice.

DAN:		(SLIGHT PAUSE) Okay...

STEVE:		It's fourteen days to San Francisco, Dan. Make the most

		of 'em.

DAN:		(QUIETLY, SLOWLY) Thanks...I will.

<u>MUSIC:		(ACCENT CHORD..AND RESOLVE INTO SHIP'S ORCHESTRA..</u>
 
		<u>'AUF WIEDERSEHEN' IN LOW B.G.)</u>

BARTENDER:	Mister, I've been tendin' bar for twenty years, but I

		never saw a cocktail like that. (<u>GLASS CLINKS</u>)

DAN:		I know it. That's why I always mix it myself..Let me

		see now, did I put in everything? Lemon, Pernod, sugar,

		Cointreau, bitters, bourbon...yes, I think that does it.

		Stir well and pour. Go ahead.

<u>SOUND:		COCKTAIL BEING STIRRED BY SPOON</u>

BARTENDER:	What d'you call it, Mister?

DAN:		Paradise.

BARTENDER:	Paradise, huh? <u>I'd</u> call it somethin' else if I had to

		mix 'em very often. (<u>STIRRING STOPS</u>) Well -- here

		goes ....(<u>SHAKER CLINKS ON GLASS</u>)

[8]

DAN:		Bartender -- when anyone comes along who knows that

		every second of life is important -- make him one of these.

BARTENDER:	Yes, sir.

JOAN:		(QUIETLY) And you can start with me.

DAN:		(STARTLED) Huh?

JOAN:		(LIGHTLY) <u>I</u> know every second is important.

DAN:		(SMILING) Then allow me, Madam.. (SHAKER CLINKS ON GLASS)

		A few drops of Paradise.

JOAN:		Think of that!

DAN:		But <u>just</u> a few drops.

JOAN:		(LAUGHING) <u>Just</u>.

DAN:		(SIMPLY) My name is Dan.

JOAN:		Mine's Joan.

DAN:		Hello, Joan.

JOAN:		Hello, Dan.

DAN:		(GRAVELY) Well -- here's to a brief meeting.

JOAN:		Yes -- hail and farewell!

DAN:		No. That sounds a little too ruthless..Let's follow

		the music - 'Auf Wiedersehen'.

JOAN:		(SMILING) The French say 'au revoir'.

DAN:		(SMILING) We just say 'be seeing you'.

JOAN:		(LIGHTLY) When? Where?

DAN:		That's hard to say. I don't plan very far ahead.

JOAN:		(DISAPPOINTED) Oh....

[9]

DAN:		(GRINS) But if someone really wanted to, she might

		find me out on B-Deck later.

JOAN:		B-Deck. Any special time?

DAN:		Oh, I'd say when the sun is going down..goodbye, Joan.

JOAN:		(SMILES) Auf wiedersehen, Dan.

<u>MUSIC:		(UP FULL...AND FADE OUT INTO:)</u> 

<u>SOUND:		(SHIP'S ENGINES..IN VERY FAINT B.G. WHISTLE)</u>

JOAN:		Well...here it is B-Deck, and the sun's going down.

DAN:		(GRINS) Did you think it wouldn't? Beautiful, Isn't it? .

		(SOBERLY) Beautiful...

JOAN:		Dan, what does it make you think about?

DAN:		Oh, I don't know..The Angelus..

JOAN:		(LAUGHS) It's a silly game -- but will you play it with

		me?

DAN:		Sure. What is it?

JOAN:		It's a game where I can find out all about you.

DAN:		What do we do?

JOAN:		I say words or phrases -- you say whatever comes to your

		mind.

DAN:		(SMILING) Go ahead.

JOAN:		All right...Bubbling water.

DAN:		Laughter.

JOAN:		And laughter?

[10]

DAN:		The little crinkles around your eyes.

JOAN:		(LAUGHING) Life?

DAN:		Death.

JOAN:		Good!..Freedom?

DAN:		Adventure.

JOAN:		Adventure?

DAN:		Excitement.

JOAN:		Will-o'-the-wisp?..(AS DAN PAUSES) Quickly!

DAN:		A sadness..a long search....

JOAN:		Love?

DAN:		(QUIETLY) The end of the search....(A PAUSE, THEN

		SMILING) Know all about me now?

JOAN:		(SOFTLY) Yes...yes, I think I do....

STEVE:		(SLIGHT PAUSE...OFF) Dan --?

DAN:		Huh?....Oh hello, Steve...(<u>STEPS, COMING IN</u>) Joan, you

		haven't met Steve, have you? Miss Ames -- Mr. Burke.

JOAN:		How do you do, Mr. Burke.

DAN:		Steve's an old friend of mine. We're sort of travelling

		together.

STEVE:		Yeah - we're together all the time.

DAN:		Practically inseparable.

JOAN:		How nice! (SMILES) But, Mr. Burke, may I borrow on

		occasion?

STEVE:		Sure -- as long as you don't lose him, Miss.

[11]

JOAN:		Don't worry, I won't.

STEVE:		(SLIGHT PAUSE) Coming down to dinner, Dan? 

DAN:		Well --- Steve ----

JOAN:		Now, Mr. Burke -- you said I could borrow him on occasion--

STEVE:		(WARILY) Yeah....

JOAN:		(LAUGHS) Well ....dinner tonight is the first occasion!

<u>MUSIC:		(ACCENT CHORD....FADE OUT INTO:)</u>

STEVE:		(QUIETLY) Dan, I've been watching you the last few days.

		You and that girl. Aren't you getting in a little deep?

		(NO ANSWER) 'Course it really ain't no business of mine,

		but.

DAN:		(QUIETLY) Then shut up, Steve. Let's not talk about it.

<u>MUSIC:		(PUNCTUATES...AND FADES OUT INTO:)</u>

DOCTOR:		(GRAVELY) I couldn't help but notice, Miss Ames. Dancing

		every evening -- the bar at all hours -- shuffleboard and

		swimming every day. I realize all those things are

		pleasant, but -----

JOAN:		Doctor, I want to ask you something. If <u>you</u> found what

		you'd been looking for all your life....if it was perfect -

		absolutely -- would you give it up? For <u>anything?</u> (A

		PAUSE) Neither will I.

<u>MUSIC:		(PUNCTUATES...AND FADES OUT INTO:)</u>

<u>SOUND:		(SHIP'S ENGINES...IN VERY FAINT B.G.)</u>

DAN:		(PANTING) Hey, Joan - slow down! I can hardly keep up

		with you! (SHE LAUGHS) How much higher are we going?

JOAN:		Right up to the top! Right into the wind!

[12]

DAN:		Next thing, you'll want to climb the rigging!

JOAN:		Wouldn't that be <u>wonderful</u>? ...Dan, this should be a

		a sailing ship - with the mast creaking, and the spray

		flying, and you barking orders like Moby Dick!

DAN:		Joan, Moby Dick was the <u>whale</u>!

JOAN:		(LAUGHS) What's the difference?...(THEN SLOWING DOWN)

		Here we are...

DAN:		Top deck. Thank heaven we can't climb any further.

JOAN:		I can climb forever -- if I can hold your hand.

DAN:		(SOMBERLY) I guess that goes for me, too, Joan. All my

		life I've been reaching out for your hand.

JOAN:		(SOFTLY) Where are we, Dan? I've lost track completely..

DAN:		We're three days out of Honolulu on a ship in the Pacific

		....one very small world, surrounded by water....

JOAN:		By water and stars.

DAN:		They say that if you make a wish on a star, it's sure 

		to come true!

JOAN:		I wish, I wish --!

DAN:		What?

JOAN:		No -- to tell would spoil it.

DAN:		Then just let me ask. Will you be satisfied - us - here -

		just us - no questions asked --?

JOAN:		No questions, Dan - except what my eyes ask and your

		eyes answer.

[13]

DAN:		Nothing said --?

JOAN:		Except what my heart says and your heart understands.

		Listen. You can hear it. It's saying 'Dan - Dan - Dan -

		Dan - I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you'.

DAN: 		(ARMS ABOUT HER, SOFTLY, TRAGICALLY) Joan...Joan...

<u>MUSIC: 		(SWEEPS IN TRAGICALLY..AND FADES OUT INTO:)</u>

<u>SOUND:		WHISTLE</u>

STEVE: 		(TRYING TO BE CASUAL) Well -- we're right on schedule,

		Dan. We get into Honolulu tomorrow.

DAN: 		(QUIETLY) Yes, Steve, I know.

STEVE: 		Uh - Miss Ames been making any plans?

DAN: 		(WRY) Lots of them....She's cabled ahead for a car.

		She wants to drive up in the mountains -- take a picnic

		lunch - you know.

STEVE: 		Yeah....(A PAUSE) I'm sorry, Dan. I'll have to put

		you in the brig while we're in port. I hate to do it,

		but I know you, Dan. I know you'd blow my brains out

		if you thought you could make a break. But I'm reminding

		you again -- that goes both ways.

DAN: 		Okay, Steve. Now we're both warned...(A PAUSE) Well,

		I'd better be getting along. I promised Joan I'd meet

		her for cocktails. (WRY) Got a toast to suggest?

STEVE:		Take it easy, Dan. No need to tell her anything now.

		You've got a lot more miles to go.

[14]

DAN:		Sure.. Until the last one.

STEVE:		Well, you know what they say - 'While there's life,

		there's hope'.

DAN:		Yes -- you might have something there.

<u>SOUND:		DOOR OPENS, CLOSES</u>

STEVE:		(TO SELF, SLOWLY) Now what the devil did he mean by that?

		<u>'AUF WIEDERSEHEN') (GLASSES CLINK) (CROWD AD LIBS)</u>

JOAN:		(SMILING) A few drops of Paradise...Is it still so

		precious, Dan ?

DAN:		More precious - now.

JOAN:		And tomorrow - Honolulu! Have you ever been there?

DAN:		Once. Just calling - like this - on a ship.

JOAN:		There's a spell to the Islands...And high up, where

		we're going, you can look down and see the ocean on both

		sides. The colors keep changing - and then suddenly a

		cloud will roll right over, like a blanket....It makes

		you feel as though you'd left the earth and were riding

		on a cloud. Higher and higher, and then - (SUDDEN PAIN)

		- then --

DAN:		(SLIGHT PAUSE) Yes?

JOAN:		(FIGHTING PAIN) Dan...

DAN:		(QUICKLY) What is it, Joan?

[15]

JOAN:		(CONTROLLED) Nothing...Excuse me a moment... just a moment

		.... I'll be back....

<u>SOUND:		STEPS...DOOR OPENS, CLOSES..MUSIC OUT, AS SHIP'S ENGINES</u>

JOAN:		(TO SELF, DESPERATELY) Not yet..Oh, please - not now! It

		- it couldn't happen now!....

DOCTOR:		(SLIGHTLY OFF) Miss Ames --?? .... (COMING IN) Miss Ames,

		are you all right?

JOAN:		(CONTROLLED) Yes...Yes, Doctor, I'm all right...

DOCTOR:		(TROUBLED) I saw you standing here - I thought, perhaps..

		(DOESN'T SAY IT)

JOAN:		(PAIN IS GOING) Oh, no -- I just came out for some air,

		that's all.

DOCTOR:		(QUIETLY) Well, just remember I'm here -- in case you

		need me. (FADING) Goodnight, Miss Ames...

JOAN:		Goodnight, Doctor. (DOOR OPENS...DOOR CLOSES)

DAN: 		(OFF) Joan --? (COMING IN) Joan, what's the matter?

		Why did you rush off like that?

JOAN:		I don't know, Dan...Maybe because I've never been so

		happy in my life..The music - and you - and - well, I

		guess it was all too much for me.

DAN:		(GENTLY) Hail and farewell - remember?

JOAN:		No - not farewell! It isn't farewell, is it, Dan? (NO

		ANSWER) Is it?...(NO ANSWER) Dan -- what is it you want

		to say to me? Let me help you...

DAN:		If you only could!

[16]

JOAN:		I couldn't lose you now - ever! You know that, don't

		you?... (NO ANSWER) Don't you?

DAN:		Yes...I do...

JOAN:		Then why were you talking about farewell?... (NO ANSWER)

		What is it, Dan?

DAN:		Well -- you've made the present so perfect..and any

		future is uncertain, isn't it?

JOAN:		Not ours!

DAN:		I - I'm grateful, that's all. That's what I was trying

		to say.

JOAN:		Dan -- you do belong to me? You really do belong to me?

DAN:		Yes...the best of me is yours...

JOAN:		And tomorrow... tomorrow will belong just to the two of

		us, won't it? (NO ANSWER) Won't it, Dan?

DAN:		(PAUSE, THEN QUIETLY) Yes... Joan, every minute I can 

		give you.

<u>SECOND COMMERCIAL</u>

SMITH:		(LEAD IN) And now a brief intermission and time for a smoke!

		Are you enjoying a mild cigarette?

BARCLAY: 	How mild can a cigarette be?

SMITH: 		Smoke Camels and see.

BARCLAY: 	Yes, see how Camel's choice tobaccos, properly aged and
         
		expertly blended, give the double enjoyment of rich, full

		flavor and cool, cool mildness.

SMITH: 		In a recent, coast-to-coast smoking test, hundreds of men and

		women smoked Camels, and only Camels, for thirty days...an

		average of one to two packs a day. Noted throat specialists

		examined these smokers' throats every week...made two

		thousand, four hundred and seventy careful examinations in

		all. And these doctors reported <u>not one single case of</u>
        
		<u>throat irritation due to smoking Camels!</u>

BARCLAY: 	See how mild a cigarette <u>can</u> be! Try Camels. If, at any

		time, you're not convinced that Camels are the <u>mildest</u>

		cigarette you've ever smoked, return the package with the

		unused cigarettes to the makers of Camels, and you'll receive

		its full purchase price, plus postage!

<u>THIRD COMMERCIAL</u>

SMITH:		Our stars - Jane Wyman, Lew Ayres and Charles Bickford

		will return to the microphone in just a moment.

BARCLAY:	The man who has written some of America's greatest hit

		tunes tells about the cigarette that made a hit with

		him. Here's what Cole Porter said:

W. CRAIG:	"Camels have been a hit with me for years. They've got

		the flavor and they're <u>mild</u>."

SMITH:		Camels <u>are</u> mild! In a recent smoking test, hundreds of

		people smoked only Camels for thirty days. Each week,

		noted throat specialists examined the throats of these

		smokers and they reported <u>not one single case of throat</u>

		<u>irritation due to smoking Camels!</u>

BARCLAY:	Test Camel mildness yourself. If, at any time you're

		not convinced that Camels are the mildest cigarette

		you've ever smoked, return the package with the unused

		cigarettes to the makers of Camels and you'll receive its

		full purchase price, plus postage.

SMITH:		Yes, try Camels. And when buying Camels, remember....

		Camels by the carton are the best buy!

<u>MUSIC:		TAG</u>

		But first, a final word of thanks to our stars for their

		magnificent performances. Jane, Lew and Charles - you've

		given us a memorable half hour tonight.

AYRES:		Well, Verne, in inviting us here, the Screen Guild

		Players have given <u>us</u> an opportunity to support one of

		Hollywood's finest activities - the Motion Picture Relief

		Fund and its County House and Hospital, which all gain so

		much from this radio program. That's a privilege, isn't 

		it, Charles?

BICKFORD:	It certainly is, Lew - and for more reasons than one.

		Each week the makers of Camel Cigarettes do a great work,

		too. They send free smokes to Service hospitals all over

		the country.

WYMAN:		That's right, Charlie. And this week, among other

		hospitals, free Camels are being sent to: Veterans'

		Hospital, Perry Point, Maryland...U.S. Naval Hospital,

		Houston, Texas...and U.S. Marine Hospital, Cleveland,

		Ohio.

		That makes a total of more than one hundred and eighty-

		seven million cigarettes that the Camel people have sent

		to servicemen, servicewomen and veterans!

		Happy smoking, fellows, your cigarettes are on the way to

		you now, with the compliments of Camels!
