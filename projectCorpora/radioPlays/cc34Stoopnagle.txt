T.  Budd, we've interviewed the little-known men of industry, we've 
interviewed the never-men like, say the fellow who claims he never touched wet 
paint to see if it's wet, but there's one class of people we've never really 
reached. The Desire Men.

H.  The Desire Men? What are they?

T.  Well, you know every human being has a certain desire -- that is, most of 
them do. Some desire good things and some bad. But in addition to the normal, 
sane folks, there are certain individuals who very greatly desire to do stuff 
which they finally actually do. You take, for instance, a fellow of my 
acquaintance who has a mania for paper clips.

H.  You mean he <u>eats</u> paper clips?

T.  No. He bends paper clips. He can't see a paper clip without picking it up 
and bending it out straight so you can never use it again. Did you ever see a 
fellow like that?

H.  I know a guy whose greatest desire is to dip the toe of his shoe in the 
fresh concrete, when they're making a sidewalk.

T.  Well, I've asked Mr. Pape-uel Q. Clipnagle to the program tonight and, 
Budd, just for your own satisfaction, ask him about this desire of his. 
Alright, Mr. Clipnagle!....This gentleman with the over-sized forehead here is 
Budd.

H.  Howdy you do, Mr. Clipnagle!

T.  (SLOW AND LOW) Hm...Got any paper clips around loose?

H.  You can't leave the paper clips alone a minute, can you? Here's one for 
you.

T.  Hm...Thank you. Look how nicely she bends out straight. Ain't she a daisy!

BIZ: (SQUEAK)

T.  Looka that.

H.  That clip squeaks, Mr. Clipstoop. You should have some oil for it.

T.  I like 'em when they squeak. It's more interesting then to bend 'em out 
straight. 

H.  Do you mind if I ask you a few rather personal questions about your 
fondness for bending paper clips? 

T.  Go right ahead. You won't mind if I do a little bending, though, while 
you're talking, will you? 

H.  No, that's alright, only don't squeak.

BIZ: (SQUEAK)

T.  No, I won't.

BIZ: (SQUEAK)

H.  That's fine. Listen, Mr. Stoopclip. How did it happen that you got 
interested in this fascinating pastime?

T.  Unh. Unh.

H.  Perhaps you didn't hear me. How did it happen....

T.  Unh...unh...unh...

H.  ...how did it happen that you got interested in this fascinating pastime?

T.  Unh...etc. Well, I guess I'm stumped on this one.

H.  Good gracious, man. That isn't a paper clip you have there, that's a 
wrought-iron plant-stand!

		(BELL)

T.  (REG) Perhaps you, too, know of someone who has a pet desire which he 
fulfills at the slightest provocation. If so, won't you write in and let us 
know? For the best suggestion we will pay...a, we will pay...that is, I will 
pay Budd the 10 dollars I owe him.

H.  Goody, goody.

T.  And for the second best suggestion, he will pay me the fifty he owes me.

H.  UNH!

				SPORTS ANNOUNCER:
(ON CUE OVER CROWD BACKGROUND) ...it's a tense situation in the ninth inning 
here at the Polo Grounds and it looks like the Giants are on the spot. The 
Cubs have two men on base...and only one out! Can those Giants protect that 
slender one run lead? The heavy-hitting Chuck Klein there at bat for the Cubs 
---Hubbell winds up...the pitch... 

BIZ: (BALL LANDS SOLIDLY IN GLOVE) (CROWD REACTION)

				UMPIRE:
(OFF) Ball...one! 

				SPORTS ANNOUNCER:
...and throws him a ball. Klein shakes his head at Hubbell, he doesn't expect 
a base on balls, no sir. Last half of the ninth inning here at the Polo 
Grounds, Giants leading two to one. But the Cubs have men on second and third 
base, and only one out, and the mighty Chuck Klein at bat! Hubbell winds up 
again...here's the pitch...

BIZ: (BAT STRIKES BALL SOLIDLY) (CROWD ROARS AND CHEERS)

				SPORTS ANNOUNCER:
(EXCITED) It's a hit....it's a h...no! No! Ryan -- Blondy Ryan the Giant 
shortstop -- made a dive through the air and grabbed that red-hot liner as it 
sizzled toward left field! Then -- then -- he pegged over to second for a 
double play -- a double play! Retiring the side -- Blondy Ryan -- with a 
double play -- wins that old ball game!

BIZ: (SPORTS ANNOUNCER'S VOICE FADES INTO CROWD ROAR. TAKE OUT CROWD ROAR AND 
EFFECTS SHARPLY. TWO SECONDS SILENCE)

				ANNOUNCER: 
(ON CUE) Just an incident in a champion's career. Blondy Ryan, shortstop on 
the famous New York Giants, has been called the sparkplug of the World Series 
winners. How would <u>you</u> like to play a game with Blondy, and maybe beat him? 
Not baseball, of course, but that fascinating <u>new</u> game called "Know Your 
Nerves." This game shows you the scores made by Blondy Ryan and nineteen other 
celebrities in a series of nerve tests for you and your friends to try. It's 
real fun to see if you can beat the champions! Your free copy of "Know Your 
Nerves" is ready complete with photographs, drawings, and simple easy-to-
follow directions for playing the game. To get your copy of "Know Your 
Nerves," just send your name and address, and the fronts from two Camel 
packages to the Camel Caravan at Winston-Salem, North Carolina, or to the 
station to which you are listening. Caravan is spelled C A R A V A N -- and 
the spelling of Winston-Salem is on every package of Camels. May we suggest 
that you send for your copy of "Know Your Nerves" right away. All that's 
required is your name and address and the two Camel package fronts. Send to 
the Camel Caravan at Winston-Salem, North Carolina, or to the station to which 
you are listening, and your free copy of "Know Your Nerves" will be mailed 
postpaid. The address will be repeated at the end of the program. And 
remember, Camels <u>never</u> get on your nerves.

MUSIC: 		CRAZY RHYTHM (Orchestra) 

H.  Colonel, here's a big package that came to Columbia this morning addressed 
to you. Shall I open it? 

T.  Well, I don't know. Maybe it's something that might embarrass me.

H.  It feels like it might be a stuffed owl. 

BIZ: (UNWRAPS PAPER) 

H.  Colonel! Look! It <u>is</u> a stuffed owl! 

T.  For goodness sakes, who'd be sending me a stuffed owl? Gee, he's nice, 
isn't he? He's the owl that wrote that song which was so popular a few years 
ago -- Who?

H.  Wait. There's a letter inside. I'll read it. 

BIZ: (OPENS LETTER) 

H.  Dear Colonel Stoopnagle (Gosh, that's a funny way to spell 'Stoopnagle'.)

T.  How's that? 

H.  S-a-p.

T.  No, that's the wrong way to spell Budd, not the wrong way to spell 
'Stoopnagle'. The package is for <u>you</u>. 

H.  Dear Colonel Stoopnagle: In listening to one of your programs the other 
night, you said something that was so silly that my little brother Jed made 
the remark that 'those birds ought to be stuffed'. That reminded me of this 
lovely stuffed owl which I have had in my family for several years as an 
heirloom. We really don't need the money, but we wonder if you won't auction 
off this stuffed owl for us, whose name, by the way, is John. Yours very 
truly, Mrs. Ursula Keating.

T.  Imagine auctioning off a stuffed owl named John. It would be bad enough 
just to auction off a stuffed owl. Well, the deuce with it. We'll auction off 
the owl for the lady. She says she doesn't care whether we get much money for 
it or not. We'll take care of that, too, Mrs. Keating. If it were a newly 
stuffed owl, we would auction it off in the regular way, but since it's been 
in the family for some time, we'll do it in a different manner.  

H.  How do you mean, Colonel?

T.  Here, Budd, you hold the owl.

H.  Thank you. 

T.  Now, gentlemen, I want you to look this owl over very carefully. See how 
lovely he is, how, still he sits. He just naturally doesn't <u>give</u> a hoot! 

H.  You're clever, Colonel, very clever. 

T.  I know it. Now I want to sell this owl for a lady and I want the highest 
possible bid to start it off. I don't care if it's a thousand dollars. The 
owner says she doesn't care if she gets any money at all for it. In fact this 
owl is worth absolutely nothing at today's stuffed owl market. Have I got a 
bidder?

[KENNY]: $2000 for the stuffed owl!

T.  Fine. Now listen, folks. Imagine! $2000 for this decrepid old owl, not 
worth the little piece of log he's attached to. Who will bid $200 less for 
him. Come, now! 

HUNT: A thousand dollars! 

T.  Did I hear a thousand, dollars?

H.  You heard a thousand dollars, Colonel. That was Pee Wee Hunt bidding. 

T.  Thank you, Pee Wee. Now listen, folks. Get your thinking caps on! Get your 
thinking caps on.

H.  The thinking caps have been passed around, Colonel.

T.  Thank you, Budd. My first bid was $2000 and my second was a thousand...

CONNIE: $500 for the owl, Colonel.

T.  Well, well, well. Connie Boswell bids $500 for the owl. Thank you, Connie. 
Now come, folks, is that the least anyone will bid? 

H.  Look how mournful the owl looks, Colonel. 

T.  Yes, Budd is right. Look at those mournful eyes. You'd look mournful, too, 
if you'd been stuffed for twenty years. 

VON Z: A hundred dollars. 

H.  Now you're getting somewhere, Colonel. You've got the bid down now from 
$2000 to a hundred dollars. That's fine.

T.  I think so.

H.  $200 for the owl!

T.  Oh, so you've decided to bid, too, Budd? 

H.  A dollar for the stuffed owl.

T.  I hear a dollar. Once a dollar. This owl is going for a dollar.

H.  NOTHING for the stuffed owl.

T.  Did I hear another bid?

H.  Nothing for the stuffed owl.

T.  Why, Budd! Apparently you want the owl. Well, ladies and gentlemen, do I 
hear a bid for less than nothing? No? Alright, I'm going to sell the owl for 
nothing. Going once for nothing (GAVEL), going twice for nothing (GAVEL). Do I 
hear less? Gone, to Budd, for nothing.

BIZ: (APPLAUSE AND CHEERS) 

H.  (DRAM) Well, folks, I certainly appreciate this expression of friendliness 
on your parts, with your cheers and applause, but I just wanted this owl, 
that's all. It was nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

BIZ: (APPLAUSE) 

T.  Well, there we are, Budd. We disposed of the owl for Mrs. Keating. Maybe 
she wasn't listening in. If so, we want to write her a letter. 

H.  Send her a wire, Colonel. 

T.  Alright, put down the owl and take your pencil and paper....Ready?

H.  Yessir.

T.  Mrs. Ursula Keating, Buffalo, New York. Disposed of stuffed owl at 
auction, stop, got bids down from $2000 to nothing, stop. 

BIZ: (PHONE)

H.  That sounds like long distance, Colonel...(PICKS UP RECEIVER)...Hello. 
Yes...Oh, Mrs. Keating...Yes, he's here. Just a moment. (It's Mrs. Keating, 
Colonel. She says she's been listening in.) 

T.  Hello, Mrs. Keating. Well, it won't be necessary to send the wire, then. 
Yes, I sold it to Budd. What's that? Well, I hardly think I could do that. 
Well, we'll see...You're welcome. Good day!

BIZ: (HANGS UP RECEIVER) 

H.  Is she pleased, Colonel? 

T.  She says she doesn't believe the owl was actually sold and that the only 
way we prove it to her is to ask the owl about it.

H.  Ask the owl? How absurd.

T.  Listen owl. Look at me. How much did we get for you in the 
auction?.......Correct.

H.  What do you mean, 'correct'? The owl didn't answer you.

T.  Didn't you hear the owl say 'nothing'?

MUSIC: 		SMOKE RINGS (Connie Boswell and orchestra, fade for announcer)

				ANNOUNCER:
(ON CUE OVER MUSIC)
Smoke Rings...a special request for the Casa Loma theme song...sung by Miss 
Connie Boswell...Smoke Rings...

MUSIC: 		SMOKE RINGS (Seque to harp background) 

				ANNOUNCER:
(ON CUE OVER HARP BACKGROUND)
For a long time people have been saying "I'd walk a mile for a Camel." This 
means that the public appreciates the extra goodness in Camel cigarettes. It 
means that smokers know Camels are made from <u>finer, more expensive Turkish and 
Domestic tobaccos</u> than any other popular brand. And of course it is also a 
well-known fact that these costlier tobaccos, used in the making of Camels 
never interfere with healthy nerves. (PAUSE) And pipe smokers everywhere 
insist that there is no pipe tobacco like Prince Albert. The Camel cigarette 
people are also the producers of good old "P.A." and they use a special 
process that takes out harshness and bite and leaves in good mellow smoking. 
That's why we urge you to find out for yourself why Prince Albert is called 
"the National Joy Smoke." There are two full ounces in every tin.

BIZ: (CHOPPING AND SAWING)

H.  Well, New-ton, how d'ye like it, workin' out here in th' woods? 

T.  Well, 't ain't bad, Hezey, 't ain't bad. 'ceptin' it gits so all-fired 
lonesome out here, seems if. 

H.  Yeah. I find it th' same way. Work all day an' sleep all night an' outside 
o' eatin' three times a day, nothin' seems t' happen, 'ceptin' when th' mail 
comes. 

T.  (SADLY) Mail. Great Day, I ain't had a letter from Esmeraldy sence a month 
ago come Satiddy next.

H.  Not sence then, eh? I don't see what difference it makes, New-ton; you 
can't read anyways.

T.  Even though I can't, it still seems good t' hear from 'er. 

H.  Ef ye can't read, how do you know what th' letter says? 

T.  I git another feller t' read it t' me -- a feller that kin read. 

H.  That may be fine, but ef somebody else reads it to you, then he knows what 
th' letter says, an' you don't want somebody else to know what yer love 
letters says. 

T.  He don't know what they say, Hezey. 

H.  He reads 'em to you an' he don't know what they say? How come? 

T.  I hold his ears while he's readin'.
