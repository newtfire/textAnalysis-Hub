NOTE: Text of script as published in Henry M. Neely's magazine <i>Radio in the 
Home,</i> November 1925. A version of this continuity program first aired in 
December 1924.



[THE Eveready Hour is developing a new form of writing--the "continuity" for 
radio presentation, analogous to the script for the photoplay or the prompt 
book for the stage. The most popular of these radio presentations yet written 
is undoubtedly "The Golden Wedding." It marks the high-water mark so far 
reached by Paul F. Stacy, of the N. W. Ayer Advertising Agency, who has done 
all of these continuities for the Eveready Hour. In order that our readers may 
have a more exact picture of the behind-the-scenes atmosphere at these events, 
I have secured the finished continuity of "The Golden Wedding" and am printing 
it here.   H.M.N.]



<i>STATIONS WEAF, WEEI, WJAR, WFI, WCAE, WGR, WEAR, WWJ, WOO, WCCO.

(String quartet begins "Long, Long Ago," softly after call letters, playing 
through following announcement by McNamee.)</i>

Nine o'clock is striking here and 8 o'clock where some of you are listening. 
Meaning that the Eveready Hour again is beginning its race with sixty minutes 
as the clock ticks. This is the period for which the National Carbon Company, 
makers of Eveready Batteries, engages the facilities of these ten stations 
every Tuesday evening for the presentation of its radio program creations.

Early in December of last year, Paul Stacy, who arranges for the Eveready Hour 
programs, built a setting for an hour of old-time songs, old favorites that 
had been requested by the radio audience. This program became known as the 
Golden Wedding Anniversary. Requests for its repetition have been so 
persistent that the Eveready artists are all set, with cider and doughnuts and 
all the fixing, ready to take us back again to the wholesome pleasures of 
yesteryear.	

Imagine, if you will, John and Mary Bishop, a little disappointed because 
their golden wedding anniversary brought with it the most severe blizzard of 
the winter. In their modest farm home, the supper table is just being cleared. 
The Bishops are alone except for Hannah, their hired girl. Sons and daughters 
have migrated to the city. Except for Hannah and a few neighboring farm folk, 
the Bishops' home life is largely a matter of living upon tender memories. 
Their golden wedding day has reached its evening hours with only the screaming 
blizzard outside for its celebration. 

(Wind machine used with moderation during entire performance, growing forte 
when doors open.)

Mother Bishop has gone to the kitchen, leaving Father Bishop and Hannah 
together in the dining room. Apparently they share a secret--but one they have 
been endeavoring all day to keep from Mother. Let us listen to their 
conversation. 

(String quartet modulates to ending naturally.)

(Heavier gust of wind just before conversation.)

<i>Glenn:</i> My! Sounds like a regular old-time blizzard. Wonder if the folks will 
come? 

<i>Alice Smith:</i> Pretty hard to keep young folks away from a party, Mr. Bishop. 
They don't mind a storm, you know.

(Sound of dishes being scraped and piled.) 

<i>Glenn:</i> Hannah, do you think Mother suspects? Heard her say anything? Suppose 
she knows of our surprise party for her? Eh?

<i>Alice:</i> No, ain't heard a thing--Sh-SH-SH! Don't let the cat out of the bag. 
Here comes Mother now.

(Clatter of dishes.) 

<i>Rose:</i> Now, John, what are you two up to? 

<i>Glenn:</i> Oh, 'tain't nothin', Mother. Hannah was just tellin' as how you was 
singing your old songs today. Sing it again, Mother.

<i>Rose:</i> Seems like we both should sing something together today, John. 'Tain't 
right to complain, but it is too bad that this storm had to come on our 
anniversary. Perhaps some of the neighbors might have dropped in if it wasn't 
so stormy. I'd set a great store their visiting us today, John.

<i>Glenn:</i> Well, who knows, now--

<i>Alice</i> (quick): Why not celebrate by ourselves. You come along with me, Mother. 
I'll play for ye and you sing same as ye did this mornin'.

<i>Rose:</i> All right. We'll have a little party--we three and the storm. You know 
it was lovely of our Bill to send us the present of a piano, but, somehow, 
tonight--I like the melodeon better. Seems a part of us, more than the piano 
does--tonight. Play it on the melodeon, Hannah.

<i>Long, Long, Ago</i>--(Rose and melodeon) 

(Only a fragment of this is played and sung. It is interrupted by sound of 
sleigh bells, at a distance at first--then drawing nearer--voices also during 
following, calling "whoa," etc.)

<i>Alice</i> (stops playing): Listen! Some sleigh bells passing! Wonder who's goin' 
where? No, no, they've stopped. They've stopped. They've stopped here. They're 
comin' here!

<i>Rose:</i> Who do you suppose it is?	

<i>Glenn:</i> I wonder! (Chuckles as he speaks lines.)	
 
(Knock at door. Voices calling "Hello, there," etc. Extra forte gust of wind. 
Murmuring of mixed voices forte.) 

<i>Voices</i> (simultaneously)

<i>Sliker:</i> Hello, Misses Bishop.

<i>Rose:</i> Hello, Mr. Bishop.

<i>Morgan and Smith:</i> Congratulation, congratulations!

<i>Coulter:</i> How d'ye do! Hello, Hannah!

<i>Harrison:</i> How are ye, John, evenin', Mary.	 

(General merriment, female voices laughing.)	

<i>Webb:</i> Starts solo "Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet."

<i>Smith:</i> Joins in "With the Blue Ribbon on It."

<i>Tutti:</i> To finish ending in laughter. 

(Steady hum of chatter during dialogue.) 

<i>Stacy:</i> Couldn't let a little thing like a storm stop our celebrating this 
occasion with you, John. Fifty years married and lookin' like a young bride, 
ye are, Mary Bishop! 

(Cries of <i>No, No! Course We Couldn't! Sure!)</i> 

<i>Rose:</i> This is real nice of you, Henry--you and everybody. 

<i>Glenn:</i> Glad ter see you all. Mighty fine of ye ter turn out on a night like 
this just for Mother and me. Here, Hannah, help 'em find a place for their 
wraps. Take yer things off and make yerselves right ter home.

<i>Voices</i> (simultaneously increase hum of chatter)

<i>Female voice:</i> I'm half frozen.

<i>Sliker:</i> Come over here by the fire and warm up.

<i>Rose:</i> Lemme have yer coats and hats. 

<i>Tutti:</i> Here's mine, Hannah. Here's another. And another. 

<i>Alice:</i> Hold on there. Not too many. I ain't no plow horse.

(Laughter)

<i>Morgan:</i> Here's my overshoes, too, Hannah.

<i>Alice:</i> I'll be back again. You hold your horses, Jake Allen. 

<i>Stacy:</i> John, we druv into the village an' brought Max Jacobs an' his fiddlers 
out to play fer ye. Soon's their fingers are thawed out, they'll tune up, I 
guess.

<i>Max Jacobs:</i> We kin start any time ye say, squire. What'll ye have? 

<i>Sliker:</i> Give us a polka or sumpin' so's we can warm up.

<i>Voices</i> (simultaneously): Yes, a polka, a polka.

<i>Morgan:</i> Come on, Sarah, me an' you's goin' ter have this fust one together. 

<i>Orchestra</i> (Plays gavotte. Voices exclaiming and laughter during dance).

(Sleigh bells heard again as gavotte is coming to close. Dancers stop, 
inquiring: "Who's comin'? Somebody comin'? Who is it?" Rap at door as sleigh 
bells stop. Wind gust louder.) 

<i>Harrison:</i> Hello, Ma. Hello, Pa.

<i>Voices</i> (simultaneously): It's Bill Bishop. Well, I never. Hello, Bill.

<i>Harrison:</i> How are you, Ma? Guess you thought, Pa, we'd never get here, eh? 

<i>Rose:</i> Bill--my boy, oh, I'm so glad to see you! 

<i>Glenn:</i> Hello, boy. Glad you got here. 'Fraid you wouldn't make it.

<i>Harrison:</i> The snow almost stopped us. Train blocked for over two hours. But we 
wouldn't miss Mother's Golden Wedding for anything. No, sir, would we, Ma? And 
these are the friends I wrote you about. You see, they have never been outside 
of a city in winter--never seen a real country blizzard. Guess they're getting 
one tonight all right--all right, eh?

<i>Voices:</i> They're gettin' one all right. Yes, sure are. 

<i>Harrison:</i> Now I want you all to know our guests. Ma--Pa--folks--meet Alice 
Smith and Rose Bryant.

<i>Voices</i> (simultaneously): How do'ye do. Glad ter know yer.

<i>Rose:</i> I'm real glad you could come. Hannah'll help you with your things.

<i>Harrison:</i> And now meet Charles Harrison and Wilfred Glenn. You've heard them 
sing for the phonograph, remember?

<i>Voices</i> (simultaneously): Glad ter meet ye, Mr. Harrison. How d'ye do, Mr. 
Glenn.

<i>Glenn:</i> I was hopin' ye'd be able ter come with our Bill. Let me tak' yer duds 
fer ye. 

(Voices continue chatter during dialogue)

<i>Stacy:</i> Mrs. Bishop, the boys over to our place have been practicing some 
songs, sort of getting ready so's they could sing for ye tonight. Sometimes 
they was singin' when they oughter been milkin'. But they want to sing their 
pieces now so's they kin enjoy them doughnuts and cider that Hannah's passin' 
around.

<i>Voices</i> (simultaneously) 

<i>Sliker:</i> No doughnuts for you fellers till you sing.

<i>Webb:</i> Gee, we've gotter listen to Morgan and Sliker.

<i>Morgan:</i> Come on, boys, do yer worst. 

<i>Coulter:</i> Ho, Webb, sing pretty or no cider.

<b>Male Quartet </b>

<i>Voices</i> (applauding quartet): "Good work, boys." "That's the boy." 

<i>Sliker:</i> Now, Hannah, guess we've earned a fresh batch o' them doughnuts, ain't 
we?

(Laughter, and "Here give them a drink. Sure, etc.")

<i>Harrison:</i> Ma, our friends from the city all sing. Want to hear them sing 
something?

<i>Rose:</i> I think it would be lovely.

<i>Harrison:</i> All right. What would you like to hear?

<i>Rose:</i> Oh, anything they sing will be nice, I'm sure. I'd--I'd--I'd like it if 
they happened to know "Sweet and Low." 

<i>Alice:</i> Why, yes. We'd be glad to sing it, Mrs. Bishop.

<b>Mixed Quartet</b>
"Sweet and Low" (applause follows).	

<i>Glenn:</i> That's just fine, folks. Won't you keep right on singin'?	

<i>Alice:</i> We will, later, Mr. Bishop. If you don't mind. You see, this cold air 
has made us all hungry and those doughnuts--.

<i>Rose:</i> You poor dears. How stupid of me. Hannah, please bring some hot coffee, 
and----.

<i>Voices</i> (simultaneously): Set right down here. Hey, Lonzo, pass them doughnuts. 
Have some cider, Miss B.

<b>Male Quartet</b>
Starts "In the Gloaming," while dialogue is going on. Followed by applause.

Sings "Golden Slippers" 
(Applause follows)

boys if you want to hear it now.

<b>Male Quartet</b>

<b>Rose and Harrison</b>
Sing "Memories of the Past," followed by quiet applause.

<i>Stacy:</i> Mr. Bishop, won't you sing something for us?

<i>Glenn:</i> I ain't sung much lately.

<i>Stacy:</i> You got lots o' music left in you, John.

<i>Voices</i> (simultaneously): Sure you have. Let's have, etc.

<i>Glenn:</i> All right, folks. Sings "Drink to Me Only." Applause.

<i>Stacy:</i> That's fine, John. Wish I could sing like that. Seems like a man loses 
something in life if he can't get outer him the music that's in him.

<i>Harrison:</i> Here's an old one that I bet you haven't heard in years. Sings 
"Grandfather's Clock," with ticking of the clock. Applause.

<i>Stacy:</i> Let's all get around the piano an' sing. Where's those song books we 
brought along?

<i>Voices</i> (simultaneously): Let's get together. Yes. Let's all sing. Goin' to use 
the green book or the red one? Chatter continues between the songs.

<b>Mixed and Male Fours</b>
Sing "Medley" as arranged. Numbers broken by calling pages in red or green 
book. 

<b>Harrison</b>
Sings "Silver Threads" 
(Applause)

<b>Tutti</b>
Sings "Seeing Nelly Home" 

<i>Stacy:</i> Get your duds on folks. You see it's gettin' pretty late for country 
folks, Mis' Bishop. We sorter hate to break up a party like this'n. It's been 
fine of you to let us haul in on you this way. But we wanted you to know that 
your friends are wishin' ye well on your anniversary. There's a big box out in 
the back entry. After we've gone or tomorrow, ye have John open it. There'll 
be somethin' in it to remember the night by. I'll be sayin' good night to ye, 
Mary. And to you, John, you old rascal. 

<i>Voices</i> (simultaneously): 

<i>Webb:</i> Good-night, Mrs Bishop. 

<i>Alice:</i> Had a fine time.

<i>Morgan:</i> Night, John. 

<i>Sliker:</i> Brr, bet it's cold outside. 

<i>Rose:</i> Good-night, everybody. And thanks to all of you.

<i>Glenn:</i> Thank you, folks. Good-night. Good-night.

<i>Coulter:</i> Say, Sarah, you're goin' to let me ride home with you, ain't you? You 
promised, you know.

<i>Female voice:</i> Sure, if you keep me warm. Laughs.

<i>Harrison:</i> Ma, I'm goin' to drive Edith home. You and Hannah show our friends 
to their rooms. I'll be back in a jiffy.

<i>Voices:</i> Good-night, good-night. (Wind blows more loudly.) Sleigh bells start. 

<i>Tutti:</i> Sings "Merrily We'll Roll Along." Sleigh bells die away in distance.

<i>Rose:</i> I'll declare, Hannah's got the lamp all ready for you. Yes, she'll show 
you the way. Good-night and I hope you rest well.

<i>Glenn:</i> Good-night. We'll see you in the morning. 	

<i>Coulter, Webb, Alice, other female voices:</i> Good-night, Mrs. Bishop. Good-
night.

(Echo of sleigh bells and crowd in distance singing "Good-Night, Ladies.")

<i>Rose:</i> Wasn't it real nice of them to come over? I believe you knew about it 
all the time. Didn't you, now?

And here we are, alone again--just you and me, John, until Bill comes back. 
I'm so glad he came with his friends. They're fine folks and they're to be 
with us for a few days. Oh, I'm so happy, John. I could sing myself, I 
believe.

<i>Glenn:</i> Why don't you, Mother. Just as we used to years ago. Now, you sit right 
at the melodeon--just like that. That's right, and I'll stand here--with my 
hand on your shoulder--the way we sang so many times. Now you play. What do 
you want to sing most, Mother?

<i>Rose:</i> This (organ begins "When You and I were Young, Maggie.") Rose starts 
singing, Father joins in. Sing several phrases together. Rose's voice breaks 
and with sob she cries--I can't go on, John!

<i>Glenn</i> tries to carry melody along for a bar or two, throat tightens as he says 
with rising inflection--

There, Mother, that's all right. That's all right, Mother. 

<b>Orchestra</b>
Plays theme on "Long, Long Ago" through closing announcement.

<i>Closing Announcement (McNamee):</i> Just to let you know that the Eveready Hour of 
old-time songs as presented by the National Carbon Company, has come to a 
close.
