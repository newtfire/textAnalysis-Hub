talking about our product Zoom. But, tonight I have a serious message from 
Fisher Mills. Millions of Americans including you and your family are backing 
the government in the share the wheat program. Doubtless, you're planning to 
follow President Truman's suggestion to cut the food intake of healthy adults 
to 1500 calories per day on two days of each week. To assist you in your food 
conserving efforts....Fisher, Millers of instant-cooking whole wheat Zoom, 
have prepared a pamphlet giving typical low calorie menus...a table of calorie 
values of common foods...hints for preserving and storing your flour and your 
cereals like Zoom... and suggestions designed to help make available supplies 
of these foods to go further. This pamphlet is yours for the asking. Send only 
your name and address on a postcard, addressed to Bob Wills, Box 84, 
Seattle...and it will be mailed to you free of charge. The address again: Bob 
Wills, Box 84, Seattle, Washington. And now...back to the music of America's

wrangler...Tommy Duncan.

WEBB: A little while ago I mentioned a special pamphlet the Fisher Flouring 
Mills Company is offering in co-operation with the government program for 
meeting the present international food emergency. This pamphlet will help you 
do your share in making supplies of wheat flour and cereals go farther. You'll 
find this pamphlet extremely useful in planning the 1500 calorie menus which 
President Truman suggests we use two days a week. Besides the menus and 
calorie charts, the booklet has tips on storing your cereals and flours to 
prevent waste and spoilage...and hints on how to make the most of the foods 
you have. I know all of you want to do your part in this emergency. And when 
you serve your family Fisher's Whole Wheat Cereal Zoom, in addition to giving 
them good eating you are making an efficient use of a scarce and vital food. 
Write tonight for this pamphlet. It's free. Just send your name and address to 
Bob Wills, Box 84, Seattle, and Fisher Mills will send you this pamphlet 
without charge. Don't forget. The Zoom song jingle goes to the station to 
which you're listening. To get the pamphlet, you write to Box 84, Seattle, 
Washington. Now....there's just one more thing we want you to remember!
